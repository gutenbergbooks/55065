<h2 id="PURITANS_OF_THE_WEST">PURITANS OF THE WEST</h2>

<p>Of local phases of the American spirit,
none has incited more discussion than
that developed in Kansas. The notion
that the citizens of the State are somewhat
phrenetic in experimental meliorism;
that they more than others fall into
abnormal sympathies and are led by
aberrations of the crowd&mdash;intoxications
the mind receives in a congregation of
men pitched to an emotional key&mdash;this
notion long ago startled peoples more
phlegmatic and less prone to social
vagaries.</p>

<p>Closer consideration shows the Kansas
populace distinctly simple in mental
habit and independent in judgment. Yet
their old-time Grangerism and Greenbackism,
and their still later Prohibitionism,
Populism, and stay law have
caused that part of the world not so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
inclined to rainbow-chasing to ask who
they as a people really are, and what
psychopathy they suffer&mdash;to assert that
they are dull, unthinking, or, at best,
doctrinaire.</p>

<p>This judgment antedates our day, as
we said. It was even so far back as in
the time of Abraham Lincoln, when Kansas
was not near the force, nor the promise
of the force, it has since become.
And it was in that earlier and poorer
age of our country when folks queried a
man’s suitability and preparedness for
the senatorial office. Then when Senatorship
fell to General James Lane, and
some one questioned the Free-State fighter’s
fitness for his duties, President Lincoln
is said to have hit off the new
Senator and the new State with “Good
enough for Kansas!” and a shrug of
his bony shoulders. Derogatory catchwords
have had a knack at persisting
since men first tried to get the upper
hand of one another by ridicule, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
terse unsympathy and curl of the lip of
Lincoln’s sayings have kept their use to
our day.</p>

<p>One outsider, in explaining any new
vagary of the Kansans, suggests, with
sophomore ease, “The foreign element.”
Another tells you, convicting
himself of his own charge, “It is ignorance&mdash;away
out there in the back
woods.” “Bad laws,” another conclusively
sets down. Opposed to all these
surmises and guesses are the facts that
in number and efficiency of schools Kansas
ranks beyond many States, and that
in illiteracy the commonwealth in the
last census showed a percentage of 2.9&mdash;a
figure below certain older States,
say Massachusetts, with an illiterate
percentage of 5.9, or New York, with 5.5.
As to its early laws, they were framed
in good measure by men and women<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
of New England blood&mdash;of that blood
although their forebears may have
pushed westward from the thin soil of
New England three generations before
the present Kansans were born. Again
its citizens, except an inconsiderable and
ineffective minority, are Americans in
blood and tradition.</p>

<p>It is in truth in the fact last named,
in the American birth of the people who
gave, and still give, the State its fundamental
key, that we are to find the causes
of Kansas neologism and desire for experiment
in every line that promises
human betterment. It is a case of spiritual
heir-at-law&mdash;the persistence of
what the great ecclesiastical reactionist
of our day has anathematized as “the
American Spirit.” For each new ism
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
the Kansans have pursued has been but
another form and working in the popular
brain of the amicus humani generis of
the eighteenth-century Revolutionists,
or, as the people of their time and since
have put it, “liberty, equality, fraternity.”</p>

<p>Kansas was settled by Americans,
American men and American women
possessed by the one dominating idea of
holding its territory and its wealth to
themselves and their opinions. They
went in first in the fifties with bayonets
packed in Bible boxes. All along railways
running towards their destination
they had boarded trains with the future
grasped close in hand, and sometimes
they were singing Whittier’s lines:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“We go to rear a wall of men<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On Freedom’s southern line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plant beside the cotton-tree<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The rugged Northern pine!<br /></span>
<hr class="tb" />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
<span class="i0">“Upbearing, like the Ark of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Bible in our van,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We go to test the truth of God<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Against the fraud of man.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In exalted mood they had chanted this
hymn as their trains pulled into stations
farther on in their journey, and the
lengthening of the day told them they
were daily westering with the sun. They
had carried it in their hearts with Puritan
aggressiveness, with Anglo-Saxon
tenacity and sincerity, as their steamers
paddled up the muddy current of the
Missouri and their canvas-covered
wagons creaked and rumbled over the
sod, concealing then its motherhood of
mighty crops of corn and wheat, upon
which they were to build their home.
They were enthusiasts even on a road
beset with hostiles of the slave State to
the east. Their enthusiasm worked out
in two general lines, one the self-interest
of building themselves a home&mdash;towns,
schools, churches,&mdash;the other the idealism
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
of the anti-slavery faith. They
were founding a State which was within
a few years to afford to northern forces
in the struggle centring about slavery
the highest percentage of soldiers of
any commonwealth; and their spirit
forecast the sequent fact that troops
from the midst of their self-immolation
would also record the highest percentage
of deaths.</p>

<p>They came from many quarters to that
territorial settlement of theirs, but the
radical, recalcitrant stock which had
nested in and peopled the northeastern
coast of our country was in the notable
majorities from Western States&mdash;from
Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, and Iowa; and
from New England, New York, and
Pennsylvania also. Some came, indeed,
who could trace no descent from Puritan
or Quaker or Huguenot forebear. But
there was still the potent heirship of
spirit.</p>

<p>To these men nature gave the gift of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
seeing their side of the then universal
question. She added a living sympathy
with workers, and an acute sense of the
poverty and oppression which humanity
at large is always suffering from those
who take because they have power. A
free discussion of slavery and their opposition
to slave-holding had put this
deep down in their hearts.</p>

<p>Each man of them&mdash;and each woman
also&mdash;was in fixed principle and earnestness
a pioneer, in pursuit of and dwelling
in a world not yet before the eyes of
flesh but sun-radiant to the eyes of the
spirit&mdash;the ideal the pioneer must ever
see&mdash;and holding the present and actual
as but a mote in the beam from that
central light.</p>

<p>From a more humorous point of view,
each man was clearly a Knight of La
Mancha stripped of the mediæval and
Spanish trapping of his prototype. His
Dulcinea&mdash;an unexampled combination
of idealism and practicality&mdash;his much-enduring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
wife, upon whose frame and
anxious-eyed face were stamped a yearning
for the graces of life. Her fervor,
with true woman strength, was ever persistent.
“I always compose my poems
best,” said one of the haler of these
dames whose verses piped from a corner
of the University town’s morning journal,
“on wash-day and over the tub.”</p>

<p>These were the conditions of those
men and women of the fifties and early
sixties to less lifted, more fleshly souls.
The old enthusiasm that lighted our race
in 1620 and many sequent years in Massachusetts
Bay, and the old devotion
that led the Huguenots and other oppressed
peoples to our Southern coasts
and on “over the mountains,” were kindled
afresh. And the old exaltation of
the descendants of these many peoples&mdash;the
uplifting that made way for and
supported the act of the Fourth of July
in 1776&mdash;rose anew. The flame of an
idea was in the air heating and refining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
the grossest spirits&mdash;and the subtle
forces of the Kansans’ vanguard were
far from the grossest.</p>

<p>Once in their new home these men and
women lived under circumstances a people
has almost never thriven under&mdash;circumstances
which would prey upon
every fibre of calmness, repose, and
sober-mindedness, and possibly in the
end deprive their folk of consideration
for the past and its judgments. “Govern
the Kansas of 1855 and ’56!” exclaimed
Governor Shannon years after
that time. “You might as well have
attempted to govern the devil in hell.”
“Shall the Sabbath never immigrate,”
cried a Massachusetts woman in 1855
in a letter to friends at home, “and the
commandments too?”</p>

<p>Among this people was little presence
of what men had wrought. As in the
early settlements of our Atlantic seaboard,
all was to be made, everything to
be done, even to the hewing of logs for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
houses and digging of wells for water;
and in Kansas pressure for energy and
time was vastly increased over those
earlier years by the seaboard. The
draughting of laws for controlling a
mixed population, with elements in it
confessedly there for turbulence and
bloodshed, was for a time secondary to
shingle-making.</p>

<p>Such primitive efforts were more than
a generation ago&mdash;in fact, fifty years.
But the spirit with which those early
comers inaugurated and carried on their
settlement did not perish when the daily
need of its support had passed away.
It still abode as a descent of spirit,
meaning an inheritance of spirit, a contagion
of spirit, and to its characteristic
features we can to-day as easily point&mdash;to
its human sympathies and willingness
for experiment&mdash;as to the persistence
of a physical mark&mdash;the Bourbon
nose in royal portraits, say, or the “Austrian
lips” of the Hapsburg mouth. Its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
evidences are all about you when you are
within the confines of the present-day
Kansans, and you are reminded of the
Puritanism which still subordinates to
itself much that is alien in Massachusetts;
or you think of the sturdy practicality
of the early Dutch which still
modifies New York; or you may go
farther afield and recall the most persistent
spirit of the Gauls of Cæsar, novis
plerumque rebus student, which to our
time has been the spirit of the Gauls of
the Empire and of President Loubet.</p>

<p>The Kansan has still his human-heartedness
and his willingness to experiment
for better things. Exploded hypotheses
in manufacture, farming, and other interests
scattered in startling frequency
over the vast acreage of his State, testify
to these traits.</p>

<p>He has to this day kept his receptivity
of mind. Even now he scorns a consideration
for fine distinctions. He still
loves a buoyant optimism. And for all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
these reasons he often and readily grants
faith to the fellow who amuses him, who
can talk loud and fast, who promises
much, and who gets the most notices in
his local dailies. He is like the author
of Don Juan, inasmuch as he “wants a
hero,” and at times he is willing to put
up with as grievous a one as was foisted
upon the poet. In the end, however, he
has native bed-rock sense, and as his
politics in their finality show, he commonly
measures rascals aright. But in
his active pursuit and process of finding
them out he has offered himself a spectacle
to less simple-minded, more sophisticated
men.</p>

<p>Some years ago, in a grove of primeval
oaks, elms, and black-walnuts neighboring
the yellow Kaw and their University
town, those settlers of early days held
an old-time barbecue. The meeting fell
in the gold and translucence of the September
that glorifies that land. Great
crowds of men and women came by rail
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
and by wagon, and walking about in the
shade, or in the purple clouds that rose
from the trampings of many feet and
stood gleaming in the sunshine, they
were stretching hands to one another
and crying each to some new-discovered,
old acquaintance, “Is this you?” “How
long is it now?” “Thirty-five years?”
“You’ve prospered?” and such words
as old soldiers would use having fought
a great fight together&mdash;not for pelf or
loot but for moral outcome&mdash;and had
then lost one another for many a year.</p>

<p>Moving among them you would readily
see signs of that “possession of the
god” the Greeks meant when they said
ἐνθουσιαμóς. Characteristic marks of it
were at every turn. There was the
mobile body&mdash;nervous, angular, expressive&mdash;and
a skin of fine grain. There
was the longish hair, matted, if very fine,
in broad locks; if coarse, standing about
the head in electric stiffness and confusion&mdash;the
hair shown in the print of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
John Brown, in fact. There were eyes
often saddened by the sleeplessness of
the idealist&mdash;eyes with an uneasy glitter
and a vision directed far away, as if
not noting life, nor death, nor daily
things near by, but fixed rather upon
some startling shape on the horizon.
The teeth were inclined to wedge-shape
and set far apart. There was a firmly
shut and finely curved mouth. “We
make our own mouths,” says Dr.
Holmes. About this people was smouldering
fire which might leap into flame
at any gust of mischance or oppression.</p>

<p>This describes the appearance in
later decades of the corporate man of
the fifties and early sixties&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">“to whom was given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So much of earth, so much of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such impetuous blood.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A sky whose mystery and melancholy,
whose solitary calm and elemental rage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
stimulate and depress even his penned
and grazing cattle, has spread over
him for more than a generation. With
his intensity and his predisposition
to a new contrat social he and his
descendants have been subjected to Kansas
heat, which at times marks more
than one hundred in the shade, and to
a frost that leaves the check of the thermometer
far below zero. He and his
children, cultivators of their rich soil,
have been subject to off-years in wheat
and corn. They have endured a period
of agricultural depression prolonged
because world-wide. They have been
subject, too, to the manipulation of
boomers.</p>

<p>Most lymphatic men&mdash;any Bœotian, in
fact, but it is long before his fat bottom
lands will make a Bœotian out of a Kansan&mdash;most
lymphatic men ploughing,
planting, and simply and honestly living
would be affected to discontent by the
thunder of booms and their kaleidoscopic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
deceit. Clever and sometimes unprincipled
promoters representing more
clever and unprincipled bond-sellers in
Eastern counting-houses sought to incite
speculation and lead the natural idealist
by the glamour of town-building, and
county-forming booms, railway and irrigation
booms, and countless other
projects.</p>

<p>They played with his virtuous foibles
and fired his imagination. He gave himself,
his time, his men, his horses, his
implements for construction; his lands
for right of way. He hewed his black
walnuts and elms into sleepers, and
sawed his bulky oaks for bridges. He
called special elections and voted aid in
bonds. He gave perpetual exemption
from taxes. Rugged enthusiast that he
was he gave whatever he had to give,&mdash;but
first he gave faith and altruistic
looking-out for the interests of the other
man. Great popular works still abiding&mdash;cathedrals
in Europe are perhaps the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
most noted&mdash;were put up by like kindling
of the human spirit.</p>

<p>His road was made ready for sleepers,
and funds for purchasing iron he formally
handed the promoters,&mdash;since
which day purslane and smartweed and
golden sunflowers have cloaked the serpentine
grades which his own hands had
advanced at the rate of more than a
mile between each dawn and sunset.</p>

<p>One direct relation and force of these
inflated plans to the Kansan have been
that they often swerved and controlled
the values of his land, and the prices of
those commodities from which a soil-worker
supports a family hungry, growing,
and in need of his commonwealth’s
great schools. And the man himself,
poor futurist and striver after the idea,
with a soul soaring heavenward and
hands stained and torn with weed-pulling
and corn-husking!&mdash;his ready faith,
his tendency to seek a hero, his brushing
aside of conservative intuition, his meliorism,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
his optimism, his receptivity to
ideas, his dear humanness&mdash;in other
words, his charm, his grace, his individuality,
his Americanism&mdash;wrought him
harm.</p>

<p>Our corporate man, loving, aspiring,
working, waiting, started out with a
nervous excitability already given. He
was a man with a bee in his bonnet. He
was seeking ideal conditions. Originally
he was a reactionist against feudal bondage,
the old bondage of human to human
and of human to land. Later his soul
took fire at the new bondage of human
to wage and job. He would have every
man and woman about him as free in
person as he was in idea.</p>

<p>What wonder then that he or his descendent
spirit in the midst of agricultural
distress enacted a mortgage equity
or stay law, and determined that that
law should apply to mortgages in existence
at the passage of the act! He it is
of the all-embracing Populism, the out-reaching
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
Prohibitionism, the husband-man-defensive
Grangerism. Shall we
not humanly expect him, and those suffering
the contagion of his noble singleness,
to clutch at plans for a social millennium?
“Heaven is as easily reached
from Kansas,” wrote an immigrant of
1855, “as from any other point.”</p>

<p>He values openly what the world in
its heart knows is best, and like all
idealists foreruns his time. The legend
is always about him of how the men and
women of the early fifties hitched their
wagon to a star&mdash;and the stars in his
infinity above are divinely luminous and
clear. His meliorism&mdash;which would lead
his fellows and then the whole world
aright&mdash;is nothing if not magnificent.</p>

<p>But although he grubs up the wild rose
and morning-glory, ploughing his mellow
soil deep for settings of peach and
grape, and supplants the beauty of the
purple iris and prairie verbena with the
practicalities of corn and wheat, he has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
yet to learn the moral effect of time and
aggregation&mdash;that a moon’s cycle is not
a millennium, a June wind fragrant with
the honey of his white clover not all
of his fair climate, and that a political
colossus cannot stand when it has
no more substantial feet than the yellow
clay which washes and swirls in the
river that waters his great State. In
reality his excess of faith hinders the
way to conditions his idealism has ever
been seeking.</p>

<p>The Kansan is, after all, but a phase&mdash;a
magnificent present-day example
and striving&mdash;of the mighty democratic
spirit which has been groping forward
through centuries towards its ideal, the
human race’s ideal of ideals. In his setting
forth of the genius of his people for
democracy and the tendency of his blood
for experiment and reform&mdash;according
to that advice to the Thessalonians of
an avaunt courier of democracy, to prove
all things and hold fast to that which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
good&mdash;he is led at times upon miry,
quaggy places and by the very largeness
of his sympathies enticed upon quicksands
which the social plummet of our
day has not yet sounded.

<p>No university has anywhere ever become a great

which was not wholly or almost wholly in the hands
of the faculty or teaching body. <i>The faculty is the
teaching body.</i> If you have the right sort of faculty,
you have a university though you have only a tent
to lecture in. If, on the other hand, you try to make
a university out of a board of sagacious business men
acting as trustees, and treat the professors simply as
“hired men,” bound to give the college so many
hours a week, you may have a good school for
youths, but you will get no enlightening influence

<h2 id="THE_UNIVERSITY_OF_HESPERUS">THE UNIVERSITY OF
HESPERUS</h2>

<p>During a great national struggle for
human rights, Laurel Town was touched
by the high seriousness which rises from
sincerity to the idea of human liberty
and the laying down of lives in defence
of that idea. Its baptism and its early
years were thus purely of the spirit.</p>

<p>A miniature burg, it snuggles upon
broad, fat lands, semicircling the height
that rises to the west. From the hill-top
the tiny city is half-buried in green
leaves. Looking beyond and to the middle
distance of the landscape, you find
rich bottoms of orchard and of corn, and
the Tiber-yellow waters of a broad river
running through their plenty.</p>

<p>First immigrants to this country&mdash;those
who came in back in the fifties&mdash;discovered
the hill’s likeness to the great
Acropolis of Athens, and determined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
that upon it, as upon the heights of the
ancient city of the golden grasshopper,
the State’s most sacred temple should be
built. Thus were inspired library and
museum, laboratories and lecture-rooms,
of the University of Hesperus, whose
roofs are gleaming in the vivid air to-day
just as in some ancient gem a diamond
lying upon clustering gold sends
shafts of light through foliations of red
metal.</p>

<p>The brow of this hill beetles toward
the south, but instead of the blue waters
of the Saronic Gulf which Sophocles in
jocund youth saw dancing far at sea,
Hesperus students sight hills rolling to
the horizon, and thickets of elms and
poplars fringing Indian Creek, and instead
of the Pentelic mountains in the
northeast they catch the shimmering
light of the green ledges and limestone
crests of the northern edge of the valley
the river has chiselled.</p>

<p>But how, you ask&mdash;thinking of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
fervor of the immigrants of 1854 and
’55&mdash;how did this university come into
being? In stirring and tentative times.
The institution was first organized by
Presbyterians, who later accepted a fate
clearly foreordained, and sold to the
Episcopalians. This branch of the
church universal christened the educational
infant Lawrence University, after
a Boston merchant, who sent ten thousand
dollars conditioned as a gift on
a like subscription. The institution to
this time was “on paper,” as these
founders said of early towns&mdash;that is,
a plan, a scheme, a possibility. It finally
became the kernel of the University of
Hesperus when the State accepted from
Congress a grant of seventy-two square
miles of land.</p>

<p>“There shall be two branches of the
University,” the charter reads, “a male
and a female branch.” In clearer English,
the institution was to be open to
men and women.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>Seeds of the convictions which admitted
women to instruction had long
been germinating, even before the independence
of women was practically denied
by the great Reformation. The
idea was in the mind of our race when
we were north-of-Europe barbarians.
It found sporadic expression all through
our literature. It is back of Chaucer in
annals of the people and later in such
chroniclers as Holinshed. Bishop Burnet,
historian of his “Own Time,”
and also Fuller, he of the human
“Worthies,” determined that “the
sharpness of the wit and the suddenness
of the conceits of women needed
she-schools.” Later Mary Woolstonecraft
wrote: “But I still insist that not
only the virtue but the knowledge of the
two sexes should be the same in nature,
if not in degree, and that women, considered
not only as moral but rational
creatures, ought to endeavor to acquire
human virtues by the same means as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
men, instead of being educated like a
fanciful kind of half-being.” And that
moral and prudent sampler, Hannah
More, declared: “I call education not
that which smothers a woman with accomplishments,
but that which tends to
confirm a firm and regular system of
character.”</p>

<p>A score of the names of these fore-workers
for human liberty are known to
us. But the names that are not known!&mdash;the
pathos of it! that we cannot, looking
below from our rung in the ladder,
tell the countless who have striven, and
fallen striving, that we are here because
they were there, and that to them, often
unrecognized and unthanked, our opportunities
are due. They foreran their
times, and their struggle made ours possible.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“’Tis not what man Does which exalts him, but what man Would do!”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the immediate thought or impulse
to make our Western State institutions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
co-educational, to give to the daughters
the collegiate leisure and learning of
the sons&mdash;to whom or to what shall we
trace this idea! They used to explain
it in Hesperus by telling you, “The people
about us are for the most part New
Englanders in blood, you know, perhaps
not one, certainly not more than two
generations removed to more genial
lands, and still retaining the rigor and
tenacity and devotion to principle of
that stock.” But one naturally answered
this by saying, “In New England
they did not in the fifties and sixties give
their daughters the educational opportunities
they gave their sons. In those
decades there were attempts at women’s
colleges outside New England, but none
in the neighborhood of Williams, Dartmouth,
Amherst, Harvard, or Yale.”</p>

<p>The better reason is the historic&mdash;noted
in every movement of our Aryan
race. In this is found what New England
civilization has done, not in Hesperus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
alone, but in Wisconsin, in California,
in Minnesota, and wherever else
it has united with other forces, and lost
the self-consciousness and self-complacency
which in our generation are distinguishing
and abiding traits upon its
own granitic soil. Prejudices which eat
energy and dwarf activity colonists have
commonly left behind, whether they have
entered the swift black ship of the sea
or the canvas-covered wagon of the
prairie. This was said of those who
sailed westward and built up ancient
Syracuse some twenty-six centuries
agone, and it is true also of the colonists
of these later days.</p>

<p>The drawing up of the charter of the
University of Hesperus shows how
humanly, simply, and freely State building
may be done. Judge Chadwick, of
Laurel Town, gives the candid narrative:</p>

<p>“In the spring of 1864 the Misses
Chapin and Miss Elizabeth Watson, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
had established a school here, and who
were anxious that the University should
be organized, besought Governor Robinson
to see that it was done. He, or they
(or perhaps but one of them), came to
me and insisted that I should go to the
capital and secure the passage of an act
organizing the University. The session
of the Legislature was near its close. I
went to the capital. In the State library
I hunted up the various charters of similar
institutions, and taking the Michigan
University charter for my guide, drafted
the act to organize the University of
the State.... Judge Emery was the
member of the House.... I do not remember
who was the Senator.... I
gave the draft to Judge Emery, who introduced
it into the house, and by suspension
of the rules got it through. It
went through the Senate in the same
way, and was approved by the governor&mdash;Carney.”</p>

<p>But the seed of fire from which this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
University sprang in the days when men
were fighting for unity, for an idea&mdash;this
you cannot understand without a
word about the brilliant essence that
enwraps you in that land&mdash;Hesperus
air and light. This ether no man can
describe. It is as clear as a diamond
of finest quality, and each infinitesimal
particle has a thousand radiant facets.
You think to take it in your hand. It is
as intangible as a perfume, as illusive
as the hopes of man’s ultimate perfection.
The colors of liquid rose are
hidden in it and the glow of gold, and it
gives flame to the dullest matter. It
glances upon a gray tree-trunk, and the
trunk glitters in purple and silver-white.
It is so limpid and dry that a hill or a
bush, or a grazing sheep far away,
stands out in clear relief. It vitalizes.
It whispers of the infinite life of life.
Like the sea, it presses upon you a consciousness
of illimitability and immeasurable
strength. It is “most pellucid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
air,” like that in which the chorus of
the “Medea” says the Athenians were
“ever delicately marching.”</p>

<p>It is as like the atmosphere of Italy
as the sturdy peach-blossoms which
redden Hesperus boughs in March are
like the softer almond-flowers. The
same indescribable grace and radiance
are in both essences. But there are the
Hesperus blizzards&mdash;vast rivers of icy
air which sweep from upper currents
and ensphere the softness and translucent
loveliness of the earth with such
frosts as are said to fill all heaven
between the stars.</p>

<p>Under such dynamic skies young men
and women have been gathering now
these forty years&mdash;before the September
equinox has fairly quenched the glow of
summer heat. During a long æstivation
a sun burning in an almost cloudless
heaven has beaten upon them day by
day. The glow has purified and expanded
their skin, has loosened their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
joints, and clothed them in the supple
body of the south. Through the darkness
of the night ten thousand stars have
shone above their slumbers, and wind
voices out of space have phu-phy-phis-pered
through secretive pines and rolled
tz-tz-tz upon the leathery leaves of oaks.
Such days and nights have been over
them since the wild grape tossed its
fragrant blossoms in damp ravines in
the passion of May.</p>

<p>These students have come from all
kinds of homes, from meagre town
houses, from the plainest and most forlorn
farm-houses, and from other houses
laden and bursting with plenty&mdash;and
plenty in Hesperus is always more
plenty than plenty anywhere else. Many
of these young people have been nurtured
delicately, but a large number have
doubtless tasted the bitterness of overwork
and the struggle of life before their
teens.</p>

<p>Perhaps their parents came to Hesperus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
newly wedded, or in the early
years of married life with a brood of
little children. If their coming was not
in the stridulous cars of some Pacific or
Santa Fé railway, then it was over the
hard-packed soil in most picturesque of
pioneer fashions&mdash;a huge canvas-covered
wagon carrying the family cook-stove,
beds, and apparel, and, under its
creaking sides, kettles for boilers, pails
for fetching water from the nearest run,
and axes to cut wood for evening fires.
Every article the family carried must
answer some requirement or use. The
horses, too, have their appointed tasks,
for, the journey once accomplished, they
will mark off the eighty acres the family
are going to pre-empt, and afterwards
pull the plough through the heavy malarious
sod.</p>

<p>On the seat of the wagon the wife and
mother, wrapped in extremes of cold in
a patchwork quilt, at times nursed the
baby, and in any case drove with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
workmanlike hand. John Goodman was
sometimes back with the collie, snapping
his blacksnake at the cattle and urging
them on. But oftenest father and
mother were up in the seat, and boy and
girl trooping behind in barefooted and
bareheaded innocence, enjoying happy
equality and that intimate contact with
the cows which milky udders invite.</p>

<p>Now this, or some way like this, was
the introduction of a quota of Hesperus
men and women to their fat earth and
electric atmosphere. It is therefore not
to be wondered at that these young people
come to their University with little
of the glamour nourished by delicate environment
and the graces of life. Their
earliest years have been spent upon the
bed-rock of nature wrestling with the
hardest facts and barest realities. They
have suffered the deprivations and the
unutterable trials of patience and faith
which the world over are the lot of pioneers;
and they have had the returns
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
of their courage. Every self-respecting
man and boy has been, perhaps still is,
expected to do the work of two men.
Every woman and girl to whom the god
of circumstance had not been kind must
be ready to perform, alike and equally
well, the duties of man or woman&mdash;whichever
the hour dictated. “Hesperus,”
says an unblushing old adage
of the fifties&mdash;“Hesperus is heaven to
men and dogs and hell to women and
horses.”</p>

<p>But from whatever part of the State
the students come to their University,
he and she commonly come&mdash;they are
not sent. The distinction is trite, but
there is in it a vast difference. In many
cases they have made the choice and
way for themselves. They have earned
money to pay their living while at
school, and they expect, during the three,
four, or five years they are in their intellectual
Canaan, to spend vacations in
work&mdash;in harvesting great wheat-fields
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
of Philistia, or in some other honest
bread-winning. They are so close to
nature, and so radiantly strong in individuality,
that no one of them, so far as
rumor goes, has ever resorted to the
commonest method of the Eastern impecunious
collegian for filling his cob-webbed
purse with gold. The nearest
approach I know to such zeal was the instance
of the student who slept (brave
fellow) scot-free in an undertaker’s
establishment. He answered that functionary’s
night-bell. Then he earned
half-dollars in rubbing up a coffin or
washing the hearse; adding to these
duties the care of a church, milking of
cows, tending of furnaces, digging of
flower-beds, beating of carpets, and any
other job by which a strong and independent
hand could win honest money
for books and clothing and food. It was
as true for him now as when Dekker,
fellow-player with Shakespeare and “a
high-flier of wit even against Ben Jonson
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
himself”&mdash;to use Anthony à Wood’s
phrase&mdash;when Dekker sang&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Then he that patiently want’s burden bears,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No burden bears, but is a king, a king.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">O sweet content, O sweet content!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Work apace, apace, apace,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Honest labor bears a lovely face,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then hey nonny, nonny; hey nonny, nonny.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>To one young man, whose course was
preparing him for studies of Knox’s
theology upon Knox’s own heath, a harvest
of forty acres of wheat brought a
competence, as this arithmetic will show:
40 × 50 × $0.50 = $1000. He planted,
he said, in the early days of September,
before leaving for college, and cut the
grain after commencement in June.
The blue-green blades barely peeped
through the glebe during winter. When
springtime came, and the hot sun shone
upon the steaming earth, and the spirit
of growth crept into the roots, an invalid
father&mdash;the young planter being still in
academic cassock&mdash;kept the fences up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
and vagrant cows from mowing the crop
under their sweet breath. Other men
often told of like ways of earning not
only college bread but also college
skittles.</p>

<p>Women students had commonly not
so good a chance at wresting German
lyrics or Plato’s idealism from a wheat-furrow.
Report of such advantages at
least never reached my ear. But this
may be due to the fact that women are
reticent about the means of their success,
while men delight to dwell upon
their former narrow circumstances and
triumphant exit from such conditions.</p>

<p>Some Hesperus girl may have made
money in hay, and indeed have made
the hay as charmingly as Madame de
Sévigné reports herself to have done&mdash;and
certainly, in Hesperus conditions,
without the episode of the recalcitrant
footman which Mistress de Sévigné relates.
Now and then a young woman did
say that she was living during her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
studies on funds she herself had earned.
One doughty maiden, “a vary parfit,
gentil knight,” her face ruddy with
healthy blood, her muscles firm and
active&mdash;such a girl said one day, in extenuation
of her lack of Greek composition,
that “her duties had not permitted
her to prepare it.”</p>

<p>“But that is your duty, to prepare it,”
I answered. “Are you one of those students
who never allow studies to interfere
with ‘business’?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, quickly; “but let me
tell you how it happened. The boarding-house
where I stay is kept by a friend of
my mother. She offers me board if I
will help her. So I get up at five in the
morning and cook breakfast, and after I
have cleaned up I come up here. In the
afternoon I sweep and dust, and it takes
me till nearly dark. The evening is the
only time I have for preparing four
studies.”</p>

<p>What became of this girl, you ask?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
She married a professor in an Eastern
college.</p>

<p>It is well to reiterate, however, in
order to convey no false impression of
Hesperus sturdiness and self-reliance,
that many, probably a majority, of the
students were supported by their natural
protectors. But it is clear that there
is more self-maintenance&mdash;self-reliance
in money matters&mdash;at the Hesperus University
than in any college generally
known in the East, and that the methods
of obtaining self-succor are at times
novel and resultant from an agricultural
environment. In evidence that there are
students more fortunate&mdash;one should
rather say more moneyed, for the blessings
of money are not always apparent
to the inner eye&mdash;are the secret societies
which flourish among both men and
women. The club or society houses, for
the furnishing of which carte blanche
has been given the individual humanely
known as interior decorator, see not infrequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
courtesies from one Greek
letter society to another, then and there
kindly wives of the professors matronizing.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>An early introduction into the battle of
life breeds in us humans practicality and
utilitarianism. Most unfortunately it
disillusions. It takes from the imaginativeness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
which charms and transfigures
the early years of life. In the University
of Hesperus one found the immediate
fruit of this experience in the desire
of the student, expressed before he
was thoroughly within the college gates,
of obtaining that which would be of immediate
practical advantage to himself.
He demanded what the Germans call
brodstudien, and sometimes very little
beyond the knowledge which he could
convert into Minnesota wheat or some
other iota of the material prosperity
which surges from east to west and
waxes on every side of our land. How
strenuously one had to fight this great
impulse! and against what overwhelming
odds! It was a reacting of King
Canute’s forbiddance to the sea, and,
like that famous defeat, it had its
humors.</p>

<p>You could see so plainly that this
demon of practicality had been implanted
by want, and privation, and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
knowledge drunk with the mother’s milk,
that the struggle of life on that untested
soil was a struggle to live; you could see
this so plainly that you often felt constrained
to yield to its cry and urgency.</p>

<p>And the weapons at hand to fight it
were so few! Materialism on every
hand. And it was plain, also, that here
was but an eddy in the wave&mdash;that the
impulse toward brodstudien was undoubtedly
but a groping forward in
the great movement of the half-century
that has endowed realschulen from St.
Petersburg to San Francisco, and is perhaps
but the beginning of the industrial
conquest of the world&mdash;in its first endeavors
necessarily crippled, over-zealous
and impotent of best works.</p>

<p>Yet in the face of every concession
there came anew to your conscience the
conviction, haunting unceasingly, of the
need of the idea in academic life, of the
need of the love of study for its own
sake, of a broader education of the sympathies,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
of greater activity in the intangible
world of thought and feeling&mdash;desires
of souls “hydroptic with a
sacred thirst.” To these alone did it
behoove us to concede, for through the
spirit alone could the “high man” sustainedly
lift up his heart&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The ratio of Hesperus students who
chose the old form of scholastic training,
called through long centuries the
Humanities, was some little time ago not
more than one-fifth of those in the department
of literature and arts. Since
the number was so small&mdash;all departments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
would then hardly count five hundred
students&mdash;the growth was favored
of that most delightful feature of
small-college life, friendship between
instructor and undergraduate. Such
offices often grew to significant proportions
during a student’s four collegiate
years. All genialities aided them; and
nothing sinister hindered.</p>

<p>The young folks’ hearts were as warm
as may be found upon any generous soil,
and they held a sentiment of personal
loyalty which one needed never to question.
They went to their University,
after such longing and eagerness, so
thoroughly convinced that there was to
be found the open sesame to whatever
in their lives had been most unattainable,
that their first attitude was not the
critical, negative, which one notices in
some universities deemed more fortunate,
but the positive and receptive. If
they did not find that which to their
minds seemed best, had they not the inheritance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
of hope?&mdash;a devise which Hesperus
earth and air entail upon all their
children, and upon which all are most
liberally nurtured.</p>

<p>Then the Hesperus youth had a defect,
if one may so put it, that aided him
materially to a friendly attitude with
his instructors. He was, with rare exceptions,
as devoid of reverence for conventional
distinctions as a meadow-lark
nesting in last year’s tumble-weed and
thinking only of soaring and singing.
In this, perhaps, is the main-spring of
the reason why nearly every student,
either through some inborn affinity or by
election of studies, drifted into genial
relations with some member of the
faculty.</p>

<p>The pleasantest part of my day’s work
used to be in the retirement of the
Greek study and from eight to nine in
the morning. Never a student of mine
who did not come at that hour for some
occasion or need. One man snatched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
the opportunity to read at sight a good
part of the Odyssey. Another took up
and discussed certain dialogues of Plato.
Another who aimed at theological learning
studied the Greek Testament and
the “Teaching of the Twelve Apostles.”
Others came in to block out courses
of work. Still others were preparing
papers and gathering arguments, authorities,
and data for debating societies
and clubs.</p>

<p>In that hour, too, a sympathetic ear
would hear many a personal history told
with entire frankness and naïveté. One
poor fellow had that defect of will which
is mated at times with the humorous
warmth which the Germans call gemüth,
and the added pain of consciousness
of his own weakness. Another clear-headed,
muscular-handed, and ready
youth measured his chances of getting
wood to saw,&mdash;“just the exercise he
needed, out of doors,”&mdash;horses to groom,
and the city lamps to light, to earn the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
simple fare which he himself cooked.
Many a pathetic story found tongue in
that morning air, and times were when
fate dropped no cap of recognition and
granted no final victory. In hearing the
details of hope deferred, of narrow
estate and expansive ambition, you
longed for the fabled Crœsus touch
which turned want to plenty, or, more
rationally, you projected a social order
where the young and inapt should not
suffer for the sins of others, but be
within the sheltering arms of some sympathetic
power.</p>

<p>There was the mildness of the chinook
to this social blizzard, however, for
groups moved even in the dewy hour of
half-past eight toward the open door of
the Greek lecture-room, laughing at the
last college joke or secret society escapade,
and forecasting who would be the
next penitent before the council. Also
certain youths and maids, between whom
lay the engagement announced by a ring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
on the heart-finger&mdash;these one might see
hanging over and fingering&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Vor Liebe und Liebesweh”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>volumes lying upon my table, and in
their eagerness and absorption of the
world in two, dog-earing the golden
edges of ever-living Theocritus. And
why not? Such entanglements in the
web of love oftenest differed in no way
from the innocence and simplicity of the
pristine Daphnes and Coras. They were
living again, the Sicilian shepherd and
shepherdess, and wandering in the eternally
virid fields of youth. The skies
and trees and waters were merely not
of Trinacria. But Hesperus heavens
omitted no degree of ardor.</p>

<p>And had you seen her, you would
never have blamed the youth for loving
the college maid. She has the charm
abloom in the girlhood of every land,
and most of all in this of ours. Physically
she differs little from her sister
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
in Eastern States. Her form is as willowy.
She has, except in the case of
foreign-born parents, the same elongated
head and bright-glancing eye.
Her skin sometimes lacks in fairness
owing to the desiccating winds of the
interior; but there is the same fineness
of texture.</p>

<p>Power of minute observation and a
vivacious self-reliance are characteristics
of the girl of the University of
Hesperus&mdash;and, indeed, of the girl
throughout the West. She sees everything
within her horizon. Nothing
escapes her eye or disturbs her animated
self-poise. She has not the Buddhistic
self-contemplation the New England
girl is apt to cultivate; nor is she given
to talking about her sensations of body
and moods of mind. I never heard her
say she wanted to fall in love in order
to study her sensations&mdash;as a Smith College
alumna studying at Barnard once
declared.  She rarely pursues fads.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
Neither is she a fatalist. And she never
thinks of doubting her capacity of correct
conclusions upon data which she
gathers with her own experience of eye
and ear. From early years she has been
a reasoner by the inductive method, and
a believer in the equality and unsimilarity
of men and women. Undeniably
her mental tone is a result of the greater
friction with the world which the girl of
the West experiences in her fuller freedom.
Conventionalism does not commonly
overpower the individual&mdash;social
lines are not so closely defined&mdash;in those
States where people count by decades
instead of by centuries.</p>

<p>And what is said of this University
girl’s observing faculties is in nowise
untrue of her brother’s. Nature, the
most Socratic of all instructors and the
pedagogue of least apparent method,
seems actually to have taught him more
than his sister, as, in fact, the physical
universe is apt to teach its laws more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
clearly to the man than to the woman,
even if she hath a clearer vision of the
moral order. Perhaps the man’s duties
knit him more closely to physical things.</p>

<p>With clear, far-seeing eyes&mdash;for
plenty of oxygen has saved them from
near-sightedness&mdash;a Hesperus boy will
distinguish the species of hawk flying
yonder in the sky, forming his judgment
by the length of wing and color-bars
across the tail. I have heard him comment
on the tarsi of falcons which
whirled over the roadway as he was
driving, and from their appearance determine
genus and species. He knows
the note and flight of every bird. He
will tell you what months the scarlet
tanager whistles in the woods, why
leaves curl into cups during droughts,
and a thousand delicate facts which one
who has never had the liberty of the
bird and squirrel in nowise dreams of.</p>

<p>And why should he not? All beasts
of the prairie and insects of the air are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
known to him as intimately as were
the rising and setting stars to the old
seafaring, star-led Greeks. During his
summer the whip-poor-will has whistled
in the shadow of the distant timber, and
the hoot-owl has ghosted his sleep. He
has wakened to the carol of the brown
thrush and the yearning call of the
mourning dove, as the dawn reached
rosy fingers up the eastern sky.</p>

<p>He has risen to look upon endless
rows of corn earing its milky kernels,
and upon fields golden with nodding
wheat-heads. And from the impenetrable
centre of the tillage, when the
brown stubble has stood like needles to
his bare feet, he has heard the whiz of
the cicada quivering in the heated air.
The steam-thresher has then come panting
and rumbling over the highway, and
in the affairs of men the boy has made
his first essay. He cuts the wires that
bind the sheaves, or feeds the hopper, or
catches the wheat, or forks away the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
yellow straw, or ties the golden kernels
in sacks, or brings water to the choked
and dusty men. He runs here and there
for all industries.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is because of his association
with such fundamentals of life that
this boy has great grasp upon the physical
world. In his very appearance one
sees a life untaught in the schools of
men. In looking at him there is nothing
of which you are so often reminded as
of a young cottonwood-tree. The tree
and the boy somehow seem to have a
kinship in structure, and to have been
built by the same feeling upward of
matter. And this perhaps he is&mdash;a
broad-limbed, white-skinned, animalized,
great-souled poplar, which in ages long
past dreamed of red blood and a beating
heart and power of moving over that
fair earth&mdash;after the way that Heine’s
fir-tree dreamed of the palm&mdash;and finally
through this yearning became the honest
boysoul and body which leaps from pure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
luxuriance of vigor, and runs and rides
and breathes the vital air of Hesperus
to-day.</p>

<p>But even with the strong-limbed physique
which open-air life upbuilds, the
Hesperus students have their full quota
of nervousness. Elements in their lives
induce it. First there is the almost infinite
possibility of accomplishment for
the ambitious and energetic&mdash;so little is
done, so much needs to be. Again, temperature
changes of their climate are
most sudden and extreme. A third incentive
to nervous excitation is the stimulant
of their wonderful atmosphere,
which is so exhilarating that dwellers
upon the Hesperus plateau suffer somnolence
under the air-pressure and equilibrium
of the seaboard.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the students have until
lately had nothing that could be called
a gymnasium, in which they might counterpoise
nerve-work with muscular
action. At one time they endeavored to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
equip a modest building. In the Legislature,
however, the average representative,
the man who voted supplies, looked
back upon his own boyhood, and, recalling
that he never suffered indigestion
while following the plough down the
brown furrow, set his head against
granting one dollar of the State’s supplies
for the deed fool athletics; in fact,
he lapsed for the moment into the mental
condition of, say, a Tory of Tom Jones’s
time or a hater of the oppressed races
of to-day.</p>

<p>This one instance will possibly give a
shadow of impression of the power base
politics&mdash;reversions to conditions our
race is evolving from&mdash;have had in
Hesperus University life. The power
was obtained in the beginning chiefly
because of the University’s sources of
financial support&mdash;appropriations by
biennial Legislatures in which every
item, the salary of each individual professor,
was scanned, and talked over, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
cut down to the lowest bread-and-water
figure, first by the committee in charge
of the budget and afterwards by the
Legislature in full session. One instance
alone illustrates. In the early
spring of 1897, when the University estimate
was before the Legislature for discussion
and the dominating Populists
were endeavoring to reduce its figure, a
legislator sturdily insisted: “They’re
too stingy down there at the University.
They’re getting good salaries, and could
spare a sum to some one who would
undertake to put the appropriations
through.” One thousand dollars was
said to be “about the size of the job.”
A cut of twenty per cent., generally
speaking, upon already meagre salaries
resulted to a faculty too blear-eyed
politically and unbusiness-like to see its
financial advantage. After two or three
years the stipends were restored to their
former humility, the Legislature possibly
having become ashamed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>And in the make-up of the senatus
academicus, or board of regents, thereby
hangs, or there used to hang, much of
doubt and many a political trick and
quibble. It was a variation of the dream
of the Texas delegate to the nominating
convention&mdash;“The offices! That’s what
we’re here for.” For if a Democratic
governor were elected, he appointed
from his party men to whom he was
beholden in small favors. The members
of the board were Democrats, that is,
and were expected to guard the interests
of their party. Or if the voters of
Hesperus chose a Republican executive,
he in turn had his abettors whom he
wanted to dignify with an academic
course for which there were no entrance
examinations beyond faithfulness to
party lines and party whips. It thus
happened that the fitness of the man has
not always been a prime consideration
in his appointment. More often because
he was somebody’s henchman, or somebody’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
friend, the executive delighted to
honor him.</p>

<p>These political features in the board
of regents materially affected the faculty.
For instance, if there were among
the professors one who illustrated his
lectures or class-room work by examples
of the justice and reasonableness of free
trade, he acted advisedly for his tenure
if he lapsed into silence when the Republicans
were in power. But if, on the
other hand, he advocated protection instead
of free trade, while the Democrats
held State offices&mdash;which happened only
by unusual fate&mdash;it was prudent for the
professor to hold his tongue.</p>

<p>Upon every question of the day, and
even in presenting conditions of life in
ancient days, as, for instance, in Greece,
the faculty were restrained, or at least
threats were rendered. The petty politics
of an agricultural democracy acted
upon academic life in precisely the same
way that autocracy and clericalism in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
Germany have affected its university
faculties. In Hesperus professors have
been dismissed without any excuse,
apparent reason, or apology, because
of a change of administration at the
State capital and a hungry party’s
coming into power. In various callings,
or lines of life, the individual may be,
nay, often is, wantonly sacrificed, but
surely one of the saddest results of political
shystering is the cheapening of
the professor’s chair, and rendering that
insecure for the permanence of which active
life and its plums have been yielded.</p>

<p>Hinging immediately upon the political
machine are the rights of and recognition
of women in university government
and pedagogic work. The fact that
two or three women were the strenuous
initiators of the institution has been forgotten,
and no longer is there faith that</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The woman’s cause is man’s; they rise or sink
Together.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>With all its coeducation, Hesperus has
not yet evolved&mdash;as have New York,
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Illinois,
and Wisconsin&mdash;to women regents or
trustees. The people have not yet awakened
to the justice of demanding that,
in a State institution open to young
women as well as to young men, women
as well as men shall be in its government
and direction.</p>

<p>And within the brown walls of the
institution a woman may not carry
her learning to the supreme pedagogic
end. “People ridicule learned women,”
said clear-eyed Goethe, speaking for
his world, the confines of which at
times extend to and overlap our own,
“and dislike even women who are well
informed, probably because it is considered
impolite to put so many ignorant
men to shame.” Such a man&mdash;an
ignorant man, one of the party appointees
just now spoken of&mdash;when a woman
was dismissed from the Greek chair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
some years ago, declared, “The place
of women is naturally subordinate; we
shall have no more women professors.”
It was a pitiful aping of dead and gone
academic prejudices. To this day, however,
but one act&mdash;that rather an enforced
one&mdash;has gainsaid his dictum. A
woman has been appointed to the chair
of French. It remains to be seen
whether her salary is the same as that
of the men doing work of equal grade
and weight with her own.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“We cross the prairie as of old<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The pilgrims crossed the sea,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>sang the men and women of the fifties
as their train pulled out of Eastern stations
and their steamboats paddled up
the waters of the Big Muddy. But how
often it happens that what one generation
will die for, the next will hold of
little value, or even in derision!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>Not wholly independent of politics,
not without the uses and abuses of politics,
is a great corporation which one
of necessity mentions because it has
played no small part in Hesperus University
life. In those portions of our
country where the units of the Methodist
church are segregate few know the
gigantic secular power it possesses in
the South and in the West. The perfection
of its organization is like that
of the Roman Catholic Church where it
is longest at home, or like the unity of
the Latter Day Saints in their centre,
Utah. The Methodists in Hesperus far
outnumber in membership and money
any other denomination. They are tenacious
of their power, as religious denominations
have ever been, and aggressive
in upbuilding schools of their own
voice and foundation. The question,
“What shall we do to keep on the good
side of the Methodists?” was, therefore,
not infrequently asked in Hesperus University
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
politics. The answer was practical:
“Make us Methodists. Bring
Methodism to us to stop the antagonism
of a powerful body.” Such a solving of
the problem&mdash;for these reasons&mdash;was
not high-minded; it was not moral
courage. But it was thought politic&mdash;and
it was done.</p>

<p>Some of the best elements of our day
have been profoundly at work among
the Methodists. Many of the denomination
have been in the vanguard of the
march to better things. But it is fair
to the course of Hesperus University,
which has sometimes halted, to say that
sagacious vigor and a knowledge of
the best&mdash;τὰ Βέλτιστα&mdash;were not in every
case the claim to distinction of its
Methodist head. “Aus Nichts,” says
Fichte, “wird nimmer Etwas.” But
mediocrity&mdash;or worse&mdash;did not always
prevail. Under absolutely pure and
true conditions a man would be chosen
for his fitness to fill the office of Chancellor,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
no matter what his religious bias,
unless, indeed, that bias marred his
scholarship and access to men, and thus
really became an element in his unfitness.</p>

<p>In a perspective of the University of
Hesperus it is necessary to consider
these various controlling forces as well
as the spiritual light of its students.
And yet to those who have faith in its
growth in righteousness there is an
ever-present fear. The greatness of the
institution will be in inverse proportion
to the reign of politics, materialism, and
denominationalism in its councils, and
the fear is that the people may not think
straight and see clear in regard to this
great fact. Upon spiritual lines alone
can its spirit grow, and if an institution
of the spirit is not great in the spirit,
it is great in nothing.</p>

<p>Its vigor and vitality are of truth in
its young men and women. One boy or
one girl may differ from another in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
glory, but each comes trailing clouds of
light, and of their loyalty and stout-heartedness
and courage for taking life
in hand too many pæans cannot be
chanted, or too many triumphant ἰώ
raised. They have been the reason for
the existence of the institution now more
than a generation. Their spiritual content
is its strength, and is to be more
clearly its strength when guidance of its
affairs shall have come to their hands.</p>

<p>Their spiritual content, we say&mdash;it
should reflect that life of theirs when
heaven seems dropping from above to
their earth underfoot&mdash;in addition to the
labors and loves of men and women,
a procession of joys from the February
morning the cardinal first whistles
“what cheer.”</p>

<p>While dog-tooth violets swing their
bells in winds of early March bluebirds
are singing. The red-bud blossoms, and
robins carol from its branches. Then
the mandrake, long honored in enchantment,

opens its sour-sweet petals of wax.
Crimson-capped woodpeckers test tree-trunks
and chisel their round house with
skilful carpentry. The meadow-lark
whistles in mating joy. Purple violets
carpet the open woods. Trees chlorophyl
their leaves in the warm sun. The
wild crab bursts in sea-shell pink, and
sober orchards shake out ambrosial perfume.
Soft, slumberous airs puff clouds
across the sky, and daylight lingers long
upon the western horizon. Summer is
come in.</p>

<p>The cuckoo cries. The hermit thrush
pipes from his dusky covert. Doves,
whose aching cadences melt the human
heart, house under leaves of grapevine
and hatch twin eggs. Vast fields of
clover bloom in red and white, and butterflies
and bees intoxicate with honey
swarm and flit in all-day ravaging.
Vapors of earth rise in soft whirls and
stand to sweeten reddening wheat and
lancet leaves of growing corn.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>Arcadia could hold nothing fairer, and
the god Pan himself, less satyr and more
soul than of old, may be waiting to meet
you where some fallen cottonwood
bridges a ravine and the red squirrel
hunts his buried shagbarks.</p>

<p>There “life is sweet, brother. There’s
day and night, brother, both sweet
things; sun and moon and stars,
brother, all sweet things. There’s likewise
a wind on the heath.”</p>

<p>They have most brilliant suns. They
breathe sparkling, lambent ether. They
look daily upon elm and osage orange,
oaks and locusts in summer so weighted
with leaves that no light plays within
the recess of branches. All the night
winds sough through these dusky trees,
while slender voices, countless as the
little peoples of the earth, murmur in
antiphonal chorus.</p>

<p>And above are the patient stars and
Milky Way dropping vast fleeces of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
light upon our earth awhirl in the dear
God’s Arms.</p>

<p>The West is large. That which would
be true of a university in one part of
its broad expanse might not be true of
another institution of like foundation
some distance away. And what might
be said of a college or university independent
of politics, would in nowise be
averable of one pretty well controlled
by that perplexing monitor.</p>

<p>Again, a fact which might be asserted
of a college built up by some religious
denomination might be radically false if
claimed for one supported by the taxpayers
of a great commonwealth, and
hedged by sentiment and statute from
the predominance of any ecclesiasticism.</p>

<p>You speak of the general characteristics
of the University of Michigan, but
these characteristics are not true of the
little college down in Missouri, or Kentucky,
or Ohio. Neither would the facts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
of life in some institutions in Chicago be
at one with those of a thriving school
where conditions are markedly kleinstädtisch.</p>

<p>In speaking of the West we must realize
its vast territory and the varying
characteristics of its people. Of what is
here set down I am positive of its entire
truth only so far as one institution is
concerned, namely, the titulary&mdash;that is,
the University of Hesperus&mdash;which recalleth
the city bespoken in the Gospel
according to Matthew&mdash;that it is set
upon a hill and cannot be hid.

<h2 id="TWO_NEIGHBORS_OF_ST_LOUIS">TWO NEIGHBORS OF
ST. LOUIS</h2>

<p>The Big Muddy built the fertile regions
near its course. Dropping in
warm low tides mellow soil gathered
from upper lands, it pushed the flood of
the sea farther and farther to the south.
Non palma sine pulvere has been the
song of its waters&mdash;no green will grow
here without my mould.</p>

<p>It was at its wonder-work those millions
of suns ago when the tiny three-toed
horse browsed among the grasses
of what is now Kansas. Its great years
can be measured only by the dial of God.
All the monstrosities of the eld of its
birth it has survived, and like a knowing,
sentient thing&mdash;a thinking, feeling
thing&mdash;it has been expanding and contracting,
doubling up and straightening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
out its tawny body, each one of its numberless
centuries pushing its uncounted
mouths farther toward the submerged
mountains of the Antilles.</p>

<p>In its thaumaturgy it formed vast
prairies and rolling lands. Upon its
gently-packed earth forests shot up.
Subterranean streams jetted limpid
springs, which joined and grew to rivers
open to the light of day. Above the
heavens were broad and the horizon far
away&mdash;as far as you outlook at sea when
sky and earth melt to a gray, and you
stand wondering where the bar of heaven
begins and where the restless waters
below.</p>

<p>Indians, autochthons, or, perchance,
wanderers from Iberia, or Babylon, were
here. Then white men came to the flat
brown lands, and that they brought wives
showed they meant to stay and build a
commonwealth. The two raised hearthstones
for their family, and barns for
herds and flocks. They marked off fields
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
and knotted them with fruit trees, and
blanketed them with growing wheat, and
embossed them in days of ripeness with
haystacks such as the race of giants long
since foregone might have built. In
their rich cornfields they set up shocks
which leaned wearily with their weight
of golden kernels, or stood torn and
troubled by cattle nosing for the sugary
pulp. Such works their heaven saw and
to-day sees, their air above entirely
bright, beading and sparkling in its inverted
cup through every moment of
sunshine.</p>

<p>Over this land and its constant people
icy northers, victorious in elemental conflicts
far above the Rockies, rush swirling
and sweeping. They snap tense,
sapless branches and roll dried leaves
and other ghosts of dead summer before
their force. They pile their snows in the
angles of the rail fence and upon the
southern banks of ravines, and whistle
for warmth through the key-holes and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
under the shrunken doors of farm-houses.</p>

<p>But winds and snows disappear, and
again life leaps into pasture-land. A
yellow light glowing between branches
foreruns the green on brown stalk and
tree. The meadow-lark lifts his buoyant
note in the air, and the farmer clears
his field and manures his furrow with
sleepy bonfires and the ashes of dead
stalks. Earth springs to vital show in
slender grasses and rose-red verbena,
and the pale canary of the bastard
indigo.</p>

<p>In this great folkland of the Big
Muddy, which is beyond praise in the
ordinary phrase of men, there live alongside
many other types, a peculiar man
and woman. They are&mdash;to repeat, for
clearness’ sake&mdash;only two of many types
there indwelling, for it is true of these
parts as was said of England in 1755:
“You see more people in the roads than
in all Europe, and more uneasy countenances
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
than are to be found in the
world besides.”</p>

<p>The man is seen in all our longitudes;
the woman is rarely in any other milieu.
She is a product of her city and town.
The women of the country have ever
before them queryings of the facts of
life, the great lessons and slow processes
of nature, the depth and feeling of
country dwelling. But this city-woman
suffers from shallowness and warp
through her unknowledge of nature and
the unsympathy with fellow humans
that protection in bourgeois comfort
engenders. She is inexperienced in the
instructive adventure of the rich and
the instructive suffering of the poor.
The basis of her life is conventional.</p>

<p>The dollar to her eyes is apt to measure
every value. Let us not forget that
in the history of the world this is no new
estimate. It was the ancient Sabine
poet who advised “make money&mdash;honestly
if we can, if not, dishonestly&mdash;only,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
make money.” “This is the money-got
mechanic age,” cried Ben Jonson in
Elizabeth’s day. And the poet of the
“Elegy written in a Country Church-Yard”
more than one hundred and fifty
years ago wrote to his friend Wharton:
“It is a foolish Thing that one can’t
only not live as one pleases, but where
and with whom one pleases, without
Money.... Money is Liberty, and I
fear money is Friendship too and
Society, and almost every external
Blessing.”</p>

<p>Lacking simplicity this woman is submerged
in artificiality and false conceptions
of life values. Her hair, often
blondined and curled in fluffy ringlets,
is filleted with gold-mounted combs
above a countenance fine-featured and
a trifle hardened. Her well-formed
hands, even in daily comings and goings,
are flashing with rings. She loves to
turn the precious stones and watch them
divide the light. These jewels are her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
first expression of accumulating wealth&mdash;these
and the pelts of animals difficult
to capture, and therefore costly. After
obtaining these insignia of opulence she
begins to long for a third&mdash;the gentle,
inept riot and solitary Phorcides’s
eye for seeing life which she calls “society.”</p>

<p>The voice is an unconscious index of
one’s spiritual tone; hers is metallic.
At times it is deep, with a masculine
note and force. The gift of flexible English
speech, belonging to her by the right
of inheritance of every American&mdash;she
is at times of the old American stock,
but more often of foreign-born parents,&mdash;she
is apt to wrap in stereotyped
phrases or newspaper slang. In her
bustling life, formed, stamped, and endowed
in spirit by an iron-grooved, commercial
world, she gives little consideration
to use of the greatest of all
instruments and the mightiest of all
arts. She has not the instinct of attention
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
to her mother tongue which marks
women of fine breeding.</p>

<p>The best thing made by man&mdash;good
books&mdash;she has little love for. The
newspaper and to-day’s flimsy novel of
adventure stand in their stead. There
were times when her reading had the
illuminating calm of Milton’s “Penseroso”
and the buoyant freshness of
Shakespeare’s comedies. But that was
when the rosy morning of her life stood
on the mountain-top of school-girl idealism
and looked not at things near by,
but afar&mdash;a period not long when compared
to the jaded vacuity of later
years.</p>

<p>To this shapely woman a writer is
presented as “the highest paid lady-writer
in the world.” The highest paid!
Where, then, is literature, O Milton,
with thy ten pounds for “Paradise
Lost,” and eight more from Printer
Simmons to thy widow! Where, O immortal
writer of the simplicities of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Wakefield, apprenticed in thy poverty to
Publisher Newberry! Where, then,
singer and gauger Robert Burns!
“Learning,” says Thomas Fuller, in his
“Holy States,” “learning hath gained
most by those books by which the
printers have lost.”</p>

<p>This woman is fair and seemly.
When you look upon her you think how
full of strength and well-knit is her body.
You foresee her the mother of strong
and supple children. She is graceful as
she moves&mdash;a result of her freedom and
a sign of her strength&mdash;and she is mistress
of the occasion always. In this
domination (the right of the domina)
she has, even when unmarried and as
early as in her teens, the poise and solidity
of the matron. She scorns your supposition
that she is not informed in
every worldly line, and that the wavering
hesitancy of the one who does not
know could be hers. She rarely blushes,
and is therefore a negative witness to
Swift’s hard-cut apophthegm&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A virtue but at second-hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They blush because they understand.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Although conventional, she is often
uninstructed in petty distinctions and
laws which of late more and more growingly
have manacled the hands, fettered
the feet, and dwarfed the folk of our
democracy; and which threaten that
plasticity which, it is claimed, is the
great characteristic of life. “It is quite
possible,” says Clifford in his “Conditions
of Mental Development,” “for
conventional rules of action and conventional
habits of thought to get such
power that progress is impossible....
In the face of such danger <i>it is not right
to be proper</i>.”</p>

<p>Secretly our St. Louis neighbor, like
most women, subjects herself to</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">“the chill dread sneer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conventional, the abject fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of form-transgressing freedom.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
Openly she often passes it by and remarks,
rocking her chair a trifle uneasily,
that she is as good as anybody else.
For some unspoken reason you never
ask her if every one else is as good as
she. You recall what de Tocqueville
wrote eighty years ago: “If I were
asked to what the singular prosperity
and growing strength of that [American]
people ought mainly to be attributed,
I should reply&mdash;to the superiority
of their women.”</p>

<p>Of all so-called civilized women, she
makes the greatest variation in her
treatment of those of her own and those
of the other sex. Toward women she is
apt to be dull, splenetic, outspoken
about what she esteems the faults of
others. Even the weaknesses of her
husband she analyzes to their friends&mdash;herein
is a fertile source of divorce.
Toward women, you observe, she is apt
to be metallic, rattling, and uncharitable,
or possibly over-social, relieving the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
peccant humors of her mind and attitudinizing
upon what she esteems a
man’s estimate of women&mdash;to please the
sex she is not of. To men she is pert,
flippant, witty, caustic, rapid, graceful,
and gay. At times she amuses them and
herself by slurring upon other women.
She seems to leave it to the man to establish
the spirit upon which the two shall
meet; and by deft hand and turn and
movement she is constantly suggesting
her eternal variation from him. The
woman is always chaste. It follows that
marriages are many.</p>

<p>A not uncommon fruit of marriage
vows is an application for divorce,
which she estimates with such levity
and mental smack that you would
hesitate to bring a young girl to her
presence.</p>

<p>“Has she applied, do you know?”</p>

<p>“Oh! they’ve separated.”</p>

<p>“On what grounds is she going to get
it?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>“If she isn’t careful she’ll lose her
case by seeing him too often.”</p>

<p>These are a few of many such sentences
heard from her lips in public
places.</p>

<p>Nothing higher than what an ordinary
civil contract seeks seems to be sought
in her marital affairs. She undoes the
decree of old Pope Innocent III., to
whom is ascribed the ordination of marriage
as a function of his church and
the claim of its sanctified indissolubility.
In the light of her action marriage is
truly and purely a civil contract, and
devoid of that grace, resignation, forbearance,
patience, tenderness, sweetness,
and calm which make it truly
religious.</p>

<p>She is strong, she is hopeful, she is
ardent. She knows herself and her
power&mdash;that it is of the flesh which aims
at prettiness. The divine beauty of
spirit in the countenance she does not
know. In her midst Fra Angelico would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
find few sitters. Her religion, commonly
that which in other ages passed
from a propulsive, burning spirit to
frozen formalism, is the crystallized
precept of theologue and priest, the
fundamental ecstasy and informing soul
having long since departed. If she had
a real religion she could not be what
she is.</p>

<p>Those questions of our day that shove
their gaunt visages into sympathetic
minds she has little knowledge of, and
little of that curiosity which leads to
knowledge. The fashion of her gown
and the weekly relays at the theatre are
nearer to her heart, and to her thinking
touch her more personally, than the
moral miasmata and physical typhoids
of her neighboring Poverty Flat. Both
pests the adjustment of her household
relations brings within her door. For
her dwelling is commonly domesticked
by dusky shapes upon whom also the real
things of life sit lightly, to whom permanence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
and serious thought and work
are rare. Their engagement is by the
week, like that of pitiful vaudeville associates,
and their performance as surpassingly
shallow. They come upon
their stage of work, veneer their little
task with clever sleight of hand, and roll
off to the supine inertness and inanity
of their cabin.</p>

<p>This woman has therefore in her
hands no feeling of the real relation and
friendship that grow between mistress
and maid who live the joys and sorrows
of years together. By the less fortunate
themselves, as well as by her own
shallow skimming, her sympathies with
the less fortunate are dwarfed. She
looks upon her domestic as a serving
sub-human animal, infinitely below herself,
tolerated because of its menial performance,
and barely possessed of the
soul which her ecclesiastical tradition
says is in every human form. In this
deflection of her moral sense, can the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
hand of secular justice be punishing
the wrong-doing of past centuries&mdash;the
bringing in putrid slave-ships the captured,
dazed, Eden-minded, animal-man&mdash;“the
blameless Ethiopian”&mdash;to our
shores?</p>

<p>She is born of fine material. When
her nature is awry it is because of lack
of right incentive. Old measures and
life estimates are absurd to her quick
senses, and none of the best of our modern
values are put in their place. Her
creed is wholly at variance with the facts
of life to-day. If substantial instruction
had entered the formative period of her
life, there would have been no substance
to project the darker parts of her
shadow. Her nature is now ill-formed
because of the misdirection of its elemental
forces. She knows the tenor of
her empire, and in truth and secretly
she wonders how long her reign will
endure.</p>

<p>“And therefore,” says Aristotle, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
his Politics, “women and children must
be trained by education with an eye to
the state, if the virtues of either of them
are supposed to make any difference in
the virtue of the state. And they must
make a difference, for children grow up
to be citizens, and half the persons in a
state are women.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Abiding beside this overdressed
woman is an underdressed man. His
first striking quality is a certain sweet-natured
patience&mdash;a result of his optimistic
dwelling in the future. Not
content with the present, and having forgotten
the values of present-day simple
life, he lives in a future of fictitious
money values. “All human power,” he
thinks, with Balzac, “is a compound of
time and patience. Powerful beings will
and wait.” He knows his power and he
waits.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be worth a good
deal.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p>“In a few years, that’ll be a good
thing.”</p>

<p>“Fifteen years from now it’ll sell for
ten times its present value.”</p>

<p>People have called him deficient in
imagination. Not since the old Greeks
have there been such ideal seekers upon
this golden nugget of our solar system
which we call the earth; nor since the
old Hellenes has there been such an
idealistic people as that of which he is a
part. In Elizabeth’s time, indeed, there
was imaginative vigor similar to his.
Then as now they were holding the earth
in their hands and standing on the stars
to view it as it whirled.</p>

<p>Instead of turning his fertile thought
toward art or literature, he bends it first
of all to material things. Schemes for
developing land, for dredging rivers, for
turning forests into lumber or railway
ties, for putting up sky-scrapers facing
four avenues; schemes for building and
controlling transcontinental railways
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
and interoceanic fleets; schemes for
raising wheat by the million bushels and
fattening cattle by hundreds of thousands;
schemes for compressing air, gas,
cotton, beef; for domestic and foreign
mining; for irrigation; for oil borings&mdash;he
brings his dynamic energy and resourcefulness
to the evolution of all
things but the human who is to be yoked
to work out his plan.</p>

<p>In theory he is democratic and
humane&mdash;for the future, after his interests
in dividends shall have ceased. But
his reckless exploiting of human life
for the present, now growing more and
more common by means of impersonal
agents, is distinctly at war with our
foundation, democratic ideas which hold
one man’s life as good as another’s and
which made his existence possible.</p>

<p>An essentially material basis of life
turns his natural idealism into practical
values and activities. He is an ideal
practician, or rather a practical idealist.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>His unnatural attitude toward to-day&mdash;that
is, his futurity&mdash;and his inconsiderateness
for to-day’s sunshine, put
him in a false position, which bears the
fruit of self-consciousness. Nature is
not self-conscious. The primal man was
not self-conscious. Self-consciousness
implies pain; it means that a fellow-being
is not at one with his surroundings;
that extraneous, false, or hostile
things are pushing him from his native
status. If his pain, whether physical or
spiritual, is eased, morbidness disappears.</p>

<p>In this man’s self-conscious habit he
jumps at once to the conclusion that if
you do not like his town you do not
like him. Your taste is a personal
affront. There is no logical connection,
but he has a certain “defect of heat”
which Dean Swift avers lies in men of
the Anglo-Saxon type. The cordiality
and open-handedness with which he first
met you wanes. That he has one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
best of hearts, and one of the strongest
of heads, you are sure. He inwardly has
the same faith. He knows it as Achilles
knew his own strength, and the knowledge
gives him sometimes the leonine
front which the son of silver-footed
Thetis boasted. But your not recognizing
the superiority of his physical
and spiritual environment over all the
world causes an irritation deeper than
the epidermis&mdash;to the nerve-centres, in
fact.</p>

<p>“What do you think!” he laughed,
shaking burlily and plunging hands in
pockets. “What do you think! The
other day in Washington I met an Englishman,
and when I told him the United
States was the best country in the world,
and the State I lived in the best State in
the best country, and the town I lived in
the best town in the best State, and the
block my office was in the best block in
the best town, and my office the best office
in the best block&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>“And you the best man in the best
office,” I interjected, to which he laughed
a hearty affirmative.</p>

<p>“What do you think he said? Why,
‘Comfohtaable, awh! comfohtaable!’ I
told him it <i>was</i> comfortable,&mdash;damned
comfortable.”</p>

<p>This very Englishman, with that condescension
of manner which at times we
see foreigners assume, declared such
mental individualization to be purely
American. Vanity, audacity, and self-appreciation
exist among all peoples,
and even from the banks of the Isis we
hear how the late Dr. Jowett averred,
“I am the Master of Baliol College;
Baliol is the first college in Oxford;
Oxford is the first city in England;
England is the first country in the
world.”</p>

<p>United with the feeling of personal
worth and independence in this citizen
by the Big Muddy is, paradoxically,
another characteristic&mdash;namely, a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
tolerance. He could hardly expect tolerance
himself if he did not extend it
to another who may have opinions diametrically
opposed to his own, is probably
his attitude of mind. He is in his
way a sort of embodiment of the spirit
of our national constitution.</p>

<p>But this largess of broad tolerance
leaves him lacking a gift of the discriminating
or critical judgment. The sense
or feeling of quality&mdash;that which measures
accurately spiritual and artistic
values&mdash;his very breadth and practical
largeness, his democracy, allow no
growth to. A sensitive discrimination,
the power of differentiation, is no natural
endowment, but a result of training,
mental elimination, comparison, association,
and a dwelling in inherent spiritual
values.</p>

<p>Through his worth and capacity in
other directions he would have this
quality if he “had time” and seclusion
for thought. But his life makes it possible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
for an explosive and heated talker,
a mouther of platitudinous phrase, to
stand cheek by jowl in his esteem with
a seer of elevation and limpid thoughtfulness.
His estimate of even lighter
publicities is tinctured by this defect&mdash;the
theatrical, for instance, where a
verdant girl, lavishing upon her ambition
for the stage the money she inherited
from a father’s patent syrup or
pills, and an actress of genius and experience
fall in his mind in the same category
because a theatrical syndicate has
equally advertised each.</p>

<p>What the result to politics of this indiscriminating
and non-sagacious judgment,
this lack of feeling for finer lines
in character&mdash;mark, peculiar nature, as
Plato means when he uses the word in
the Phædrus&mdash;would be hard to estimate.</p>

<p>Although for the most part a private
citizen absorbed in his own affairs, the
holder of an office has to him a peculiar
glamour. He is apt to fall into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
thinking lines of writers of nameless editorials,
who, forgetful of their own
hidden effulgence, fillip at quiet folk
as “parochial celebrities” and “small
deer.” And yet he knows that he lives
in an age of réclame, and that by the expenditure
of a few dollars in direct or
indirect advertisement a name may be
set before more people than our forefathers
numbered on the first Independence
Day.</p>

<p>In his midst is a certain publicity of
spirit, and in his estimation work undertaken
in the sight of men is of a higher
order than that done in the privacy of
one’s closet. The active life is everything;
the contemplative, nothing.
Talking is better than writing&mdash;it so
easily gives opportunity for the aggressive
personality. For a young woman
looking to support herself he advocated
type-writing in a public office
in preference to the retirement of nursery
governess. When the girl drew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
back with the dread of publicity which
results from the retired life of women,
he exclaimed, “It’s all a question of
whether you’ve got the courage to take
the higher thing.”</p>

<p>If he is a fruit of self-cultivation, he
enjoys talking of the viridity of his
growth as well as these now purpler
days. During early struggles he may
have undergone suffering and privation.
In that event, if his nature is narrow
and hard, he has become narrower and
harder, and his presence, like Quilp’s,
shrivels and deadens every accretion
save his interest. But when he is of the
better sort of soil, adversity discovers
the true metal, and misfortune gives him
a sympathy, depth, and tenderness that
charm you to all defects. You would
migrate to his neighborhood to live in
the light of his genial warmth. You
think of the beautiful encomium Menelaus
pronounced upon Patroclus&mdash;“He
knew how to be kind to all men.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>Beyond all, he is open-eyed and open-eared.
And above all he is affirmative;
never negative. His intuition tells him
it is affirmation that builds, and that
Bacon says right&mdash;“it is the peculiar
trait of the human intellect to be more
moved and excited by affirmatives than
by negatives.”</p>

<p>“Why do people buy and read such
fool stuff as ‘Treasure Island’? I can’t
see.”</p>

<p>“They read it for its story of adventure,
and for its rare way of telling the
story,” I ventured, in answer. “They
read it for its style.”</p>

<p>“Style! Gemini! Style! I should
smile! I can write a better book than
that myself!”</p>

<p>“Then it might pay you as a business
venture to set yourself about it.”</p>

<p>“It’s by a man named Stevenson, and
he’s written other stories. Are they all
as bad?”</p>

<p>Strange he should make such a criticism
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
of Louis Stevenson, in literature
pronouncedly the successful man. For
success in the abstract, and successful
men and women in the concrete&mdash;the
word success is here used in its vulgar,
popular sense, in reference to material
advancement, not to ethical or spiritual
development&mdash;he worships. Success is
a chief god in his pantheon,&mdash;to have
returns greater than one’s effort or
worth deserve. Yet he believes with the
author of Lorna Doone, “the excess of
price over value is the true test of success
in life.” None of us would think of
saying Shakespeare was a success; or
Milton; or John Brown; or Martin
Luther. But Pope, with his clever
money-making, we might call a success,
as did Swift in 1728: “God bless you,
whose great genius has not so transported
you as to leave you to the constancy
of mankind, for wealth is liberty,
and liberty is a blessing fittest for a
philosopher.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<p>The means to end, the processes by
which the successful issue of a matter is
gained, our neighbor of St. Louis tells
you with a smile not to be finikin about.
Many who have had success have not
been. Look at all history, from Abraham
to Joe Smith and Cecil Rhodes and
many of our millionaires. He himself is
not, he declares, but his acts often contradict
his assertion. So long as a man,
or a woman, “gets there,” it does not
matter much how. “Work through a
corporation or trust,” he tells you, and
smiling at you with honest eyes, adds,
“A corporation can do things the individual
man would not.” The one who
succeeds is the model; he is to be
envied; he is the ideal the ancients
sought&mdash;the happy man. Pass by
noblesse oblige, human heartedness, elevation
that would not stoop to exploit
human labor, human need, and human
sacrifice&mdash;that is, as corporations pass
these qualities by.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>In short, let us, in fact, and not by
legend alone, have the character formerly
ascribed by average English folk
to the Yankee.</p>

<p>Assumption of excellence, he knows,
goes far toward persuading people that
you have it. There is not so great difference
in people after all, this democrat
believes. When one has every material
privilege that will allow him to
assume, that will hedge and fence his
assumption about, he is pretty apt to
succeed, he thinks, and be cried up as a
man of extraordinary virtue, of taste, of
attainment. In any success, commonly
so-called, he asks little of the great
marks by which a man should be judged.
“He has done this.” “He has got
that.” “He is clever,” he says. He
rarely cries, “He is honest.” “He is
true.”</p>

<p>Marriage he is not so apt as the brilliant
woman beside him to consider impermanent.
This is wholly a result of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
convention, for women, by their very
nature and the conditions of married
life, cling more closely to the permanence
of the union.</p>

<p>In marital relations he has more liberty.
When she asks him if she may, or
in her phrase “can,” do so and so, and
in rehearsing the matter says he “let
her,” he accepts her homage and the
servile status she voluntarily assumes.
You exclaim that men for many centuries
have been apt to do this. Entirely,
if offered him by such an
enchantress.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“If she be small, slight-natured, miserable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shall men grow?”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Toward women, with all his subtlety, he
is possessed of a certain naïveté, which
renders him a most agreeable companion,
and much at the mercy of such associates.</p>

<p>On an express leaving St. Louis at
nine of the morning and headed toward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
the East, two of these men were one day
riding. A stretch of level land, encrusted
in snow and flooded with sunshine
glowing warm and yellow three
weeks after the winter solstice, lengthened
the way. By three in the afternoon
the sight of the passengers was strained
from the pulsation of the train, and
reading gave place to lassitude.</p>

<p>“Say,” yawned one of the men, “do
you think marriage is a failure?”</p>

<p>“Failure! failure!” answered the
other. “The biggest kind of a success!
Failure! Holy smoke! Why I’ve just
married my third wife. Failure! It
beats electric lights all hollow.”</p>

<p>“I don’ know,” answered the questioner,
dyspeptically. “I don’ know. I
go home every week or ten days. My
wife isn’t glad to see me. I’m going
home now. She won’t be glad. They
think more of you when you’re not home
so much.”</p>

<p>“Whee-u-u-u,” whistled number two.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>With a holiday on his hands no man
is more awkward. The secret of giving
himself to enjoyment he does not know.
His relaxation takes crudest form.
Holiday enjoyment means in many cases
sowing money in barbaric fashion, in
every thinkable triviality that entails
expense. That which he has bent every
nerve toward getting, for which he has
grown prematurely careworn, the possession
of which vulgar philosophy
counts the summa summarium of life,
this he must scatter broadcast, not in
the real things of art and literature
and bettering the condition of the less
fortunate, but in sordid pleasure and
vacuous rushing hither and yon. It is
his way of showing superiority to the
cub who has not the money-making
faculty, or who holds different ideas
of the value of living. Upon such
merrymaking he has been known to
indulge in Homeric laughter over his
own excess, and in tones heralds used
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
in the days of Agamemnon. Physically he
breathes deeper and is broader chested
than many men; he has more voice, and
he puts it out the top of the throat.</p>

<p>To watch the purple dog-tooth violet
push up through dead leaves in March;
to listen in his fragrant, sunlit spring
to the song of the thrush or the delectable
yearning of the mourning-dove; to
know the quivering windflowers that
freshen soil under oak and hickory&mdash;all
this is to him as the yellow primrose to
Peter Bell. There is no pleasure without
an end&mdash;that end being money.</p>

<p>The blooded mare in his stable needs
exercise and he likes not another to drive
her lest she lose response to his voice
and hand. But it is really a bore to
drive; what interest is there in sitting
in a wagon and going round and round?
He must be doing something. He forgets
the retaliation nature takes upon
grooves in human life and that discountenancing
of innocent pleasures is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
first step toward dementia paralytica
and the end of interest in his fair and
buoyant world. He will probably die
suddenly in middle age, for he is too
extreme in expenditure of himself, and
too small an eater of the honey of life.
Honey-eaters have terrene permanence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This man and woman are not disproportionate
neighbors. What will be
their record to the reading of Prince
Posterity?</p>

<p>The lands that border the Big Muddy
have more of the old American spirit
than the extreme East. The proportions
of the old American blood are there
greater than upon the sea-coast, where
Europeans of a tradition far different
from the ideals and enthusiasms of our
early comers have dropped and settled,
and in such numbers that they can and
do knit their old mental and social habits
into a garment which is impervious to
true American influences.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>Our old American teachings!&mdash;for instance,
the estimate of the greatness of
work, the dignity of labor of any sort
whatever&mdash;that, it was once claimed,
was a great reason our republic existed
to demonstrate to the world the dignity
of work, of bodily exertion directed to
some economic purpose, to produce use,
adapt material things to living. “That
citizen who lives without labor, verily
how evil a man!”&mdash;’Αργὸος πολίτης χεῖνος ὡς
χαχός γ’ ἀνήρ, and such sentiments as this
of Euripides dominated our democracy.</p>

<p>But in our eastern sea-coast cities,
what with the development of an idle,
moneyed class, and the settling down of
millions of immigrants, the European
conception of work’s inherent ignobleness
has grown to strong hold.</p>

<p>“Work is not a disgrace, but lack of
work is a disgrace,” “Ἔργον δ ουδὲν ὄνειδος,
αεργίη δέ τ’ ὄνειδος. And Hesiod’s words
hold to the present day among genuine
Americans.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>Possibly with the great Middle West
and its infinite “go,” optimism, and constructive
breadth, and with such men
and women as these types by the Big
Muddy, the preservation of Americanism
really lies&mdash;but it must be with their
greater spiritualization and greater
moral elevation for the future.

<p>In order to give her praises a lustre and beauty

<h2 id="THE_NEW_ENGLAND_WOMAN">THE NEW ENGLAND
WOMAN</h2>

<p>Throughout our fair country there
has long been familiar, in actual life and
in tradition, a corporate woman known
as the New England woman.</p>

<p>When this woman landed upon American
shores, some two hundred and fifty
years ago, she was doubtless a hearty,
even-minded, rosy-cheeked, full-fleshed
English lass. Once here, however, in her
physical and mental make-up, under pioneer
conditions and influenced by our
electric climate, a differentiation began,
an unconscious individualizing of herself:
this was far, far back in the time of
the Pilgrim Mothers.</p>

<p>In this adaptation she developed certain
characteristics which are weakly
human, intensely feminine, and again
passing the fables of saints in heroism
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
and self-devotion. Just what these
qualities were, and why they grew, is
worth considering before&mdash;in the bustle
of the twentieth century and its elements
entirely foreign to her primitive and
elevated spirit&mdash;she has passed from
view and is quite forgotten.</p>

<p>In the cities of to-day she is an exotic.
In the small towns she is hardly indigenous.
Of her many homes, from the
close-knit forests of Maine to the hot
sands of Monterey, that community of
villages which was formerly New England
is her habitat. She has always been
most at home in the narrow village of
her forebears, where the church and
school were in simpler days, and still at
times are&mdash;even to our generation measuring
only with Pactolian sands in
its hour-glasses&mdash;the powers oftenest
quoted and most revered. From these
sources the larger part of herself, the
part that does not live by bread alone,
has been nourished.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>It was in the quiet seclusion of the
white homes of these villages that in
past generations she gained her ideals
of life. Such a home imposed what to
women of the world at large might be
inanity. But, with a self-limitation
almost Greek, she saw within those clapboard
walls things dearest to a woman’s
soul,&mdash;a pure and sober family life, a
husband’s protective spirit, the birth
and growth of children, neighborly service&mdash;keenly
dear to her&mdash;for all whose
lives should come within touch of her
active hands, and an old age guarded by
the devotion of those to whom she had
given her activities.</p>

<p>To this should be added another gift
of the gods which this woman ever bore
in mind with calmness&mdash;a secluded
ground, shaded by hemlocks or willows,
where should stand the headstone marking
her dust, over which violets should
blossom to freshening winds, and robin
call to mate in the resurrection time of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
spring, and in the dim corners of which
ghostly Indian pipes should rise from
velvet mould to meet the summer’s
fervency.</p>

<p>Under such conditions and in such
homes she had her growth. The tasks
that engaged her hands were many, for
at all times she was indefatigable in
what Plato calls women’s work, τὰ ἔνδον.
She rose while it was yet night; she
looked well to the ways of her household,
and eat not the bread of idleness.
In housekeeping&mdash;which in her conservative
neighborhood and among her primary
values meant, almost up to this
hour, not directing nor helping hired
people in heaviest labors, but rather all
that the phrase implied in pioneer days&mdash;her
energies were spent&mdash;herself
cooking; herself spinning the thread
and weaving, cutting out and sewing all
family garments and household linen;
herself preserving flesh, fish, and fruits.
To this she added the making of yeast,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
candles, and soap for her household,
their butter and cheese&mdash;perhaps also
these foods for market sale&mdash;at times
their cider, and even elderberry wine for
their company, of as fine a color and distinguished
a flavor as the gooseberry
which the wife of immortal Dr. Primrose
offered her guests. Abigail Adams herself
testifies that she made her own soap,
in her early days at Braintree, and
chopped the wood with which she kindled
her fires. In such accomplishments she
was one of a great sisterhood, thousands
of whom served before and thousands
after her. These women rarely told
such activities in their letters, and
rarely, too, I think, to their diaries; for
their fingers fitted a quill but awkwardly
after a day with distaff or butter-moulding.</p>

<p>These duties were of the external
world, mainly mechanical and routine,
and they would have permitted her&mdash;an
untiring materialist in all things workable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
by hands&mdash;to go many ways in the
wanderings of thought, if grace, flexibility,
and warmth had consorted with
the Puritan idea of beauty. She had
come to be an idealist in all things
having to do with the spirit. Nevertheless,
as things stood, she had but one
mental path.</p>

<p>The powers about her were theocratic.
They held in their hands her life and
death in all physical things, and her life
and death per omnia sæcula sæculorum.
They held the right to whisper approval
or to publish condemnation. Her eager,
active spirit was fed by sermons and exhortations
to self-examination. Nothing
else was offered. On Sundays and at
the prayer-meetings of mid-week she
was warned by these teachers, to whom
everybody yielded, to whom in her childhood
she had been taught to drop a wayside
courtesy, that she should ever be
examining head and heart to escape
everlasting hell-fire, and that she should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
endure so as to conduct her devoted life
as to appease the anger of a God as vindictive
as the very ecclesiasts themselves.
No escape or reaction was possible.</p>

<p>The effect of all this upon a spirit so
active, pliant, and sensitive is evident.
The sole way open to her was the road
to introspection&mdash;that narrow lane
hedged with the trees of contemplative
life to all suffering human kind.</p>

<p>Even those of the community whose
life duties took them out in their world,
and who were consequently more objective
than women, even the men, under
such conditions, grew self-examining to
the degree of a proverb, “The bother
with the Yankee is that he rubs badly
at the juncture of the soul and body.”</p>

<p>In such a life as this first arose the
subjective characteristics of the New
England woman at which so many gibes
have been written, so many flings
spoken; at which so many burly sides
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
have shaken with laughter ἄσβεστος.
Like almost every dwarfed or distorted
thing in the active practical world,
“New England subjectivity” is a result
of the shortsightedness of men, the assumption
of authority of the strong
over the weak, and the wrongs they have
to advance self done one another.</p>

<p>Nowadays, in our more objective life,
this accent of the ego is pronounced irritating.
But God’s sequence is apt to be
irritating.</p>

<p>The New England woman’s subjectivity
is a result of what has been&mdash;the
enslaving by environment, the control by
circumstance, of a thing flexible, pliant,
ductile&mdash;in this case a hypersensitive
soul&mdash;and its endeavor to shape itself to
lines and forms men in authority dictated.</p>

<p>Cut off from the larger world, this
woman was forced into the smaller. Her
mind must have field and exercise for
its natural activity and constructiveness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
Its native expression was in the great
objective world of action and thought
about action, the macrocosm; stunted
and deprived of its birthright, it turned
about and fed upon its subjective self,
the microcosm.</p>

<p>Scattered far and wide over the granitic
soil of New England there have been
the women unmarried. Through the
seafaring life of the men, through the
adventures of the pioneer enchanting
the hot-blooded and daring; through
the coaxing away of sturdy youthful
muscle by the call of the limitless fat
lands to the west; through the siren
voice of the cities; and also through the
loss of men in war&mdash;that untellable
misery&mdash;these less fortunate women&mdash;the
unmarried&mdash;have in all New England
life been many. All the rounding
and relaxing grace and charm which lie
between maid and man they knew only
in brooding fancy. Love might spring,
but its growth was rudimentary. Their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
life was not fulfilled. There were many
such spinners.</p>

<p>These women, pertinacious at their
tasks, dreamed dreams of what could
never come to be. Lacking real things,
they talked much of moods and sensations.
Naturally they would have
moods. Human nature will have its confidant,
and naturally they talked to one
another more freely than to their married
sisters. Introspection plus introspection
again. A life vacuous in external
events and interrupted by no
masculine practicality&mdash;where fluttering
nerves were never counterpoised by
steady muscle&mdash;afforded every development
to subjective morbidity.</p>

<p>And expression of their religious life
granted no outlet to these natures&mdash;no
goodly work direct upon humankind.
The Reformation, whatever magnificence
it accomplished for the freedom
of the intellect, denied liberty and individual
choice to women.  Puritanism
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
was the child of the Reformation. Like
all religions reacting from the degradations
and abuses of the Middle Ages, for
women it discountenanced community
life. Not for active ends, nor of a certainty
for contemplative, were women
to hive together and live independent
lives.</p>

<p>In her simple home, and by making
the best of spare moments, the undirected
impulse of the spinster produced
penwipers for the heathen and slippers
for the dominie. But there was, through
all the long years of her life, no dignified,
constructive, human expression
for the childless and husbandless
woman. Because of this lack a dynamo
force for good was wasted for centuries,
and tens of thousands of lives were
blighted.</p>

<p>In New England her theology ruled,
as we have said, with an iron and tyrannous
hand. It published the axiom, and
soon put it in men’s mouths, that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
only outlet for women’s activities was
marriage. No matter if truth to the
loftiest ideals kept her single, a woman
unmarried, from a Garden of Eden point
of view and the pronunciamento of the
average citizen, was not fulfilling the
sole and only end for which he dogmatized
women were made&mdash;she was not
child-bearing.</p>

<p>In this great spinster class, dominated
by such a voice, we may physiologically
expect to find an excess of the neurotic
altruistic type, women sickened and extremists,
because their nature was unexpressed,
unbalanced, and astray. They
found a positive joy in self-negation and
self-sacrifice, and evidenced in the perturbations
and struggles of family life
a patience, a dumb endurance, which the
humanity about them, and even that of
our later day, could not comprehend,
and commonly translated into apathy or
unsensitiveness. The legendary fervor
and devotion of the saints of other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
days pale before their self-denying discipline.</p>

<p>But instead of gaining, as in the
mediæval faith, the applause of contemporaries,
and, as in those earlier
days, inciting veneration and enthusiasm
as a “holy person,” the modern
sister lived in her small world very generally
an upper servant in a married
brother’s or sister’s family. Ibsen’s
Pillar of Society, Karsten Bernick, in
speaking of the self-effacing Martha,
voices in our time the then prevailing
sentiment, “You don’t suppose I let her
want for anything. Oh, no; I think I
may say I am a good brother. Of
course, she lives with us and eats at our
table; her salary is quite enough for her
dress, and&mdash;what can a single woman
want more?... You know, in a large
house like ours, it is always well to have
some steady-going person like her whom
one can put to anything that may turn
up.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>Not such estimates alone, but this
woman heard reference to herself in
many phrases turning upon her chastity.
Her very classification in the current
vernacular was based upon her condition
of sex. And at last she witnessed
for her class an economic designation,
the essence of vulgarity and the consummation
of insolence&mdash;“superfluous
women;” that is, “unnecessary from
being in excess of what is needed,”
women who had not taken husbands, or
had lived apart from men. The phrase
recalls the use of the word “female”&mdash;meaning,
“for thy more sweet understanding,”
a woman&mdash;which grew in
use with the Squire Westerns of the
eighteenth century, and persisted even
in decent mouths until Charles Lamb
wrapped it in the cloth of gold of his
essay on Modern Gallantry, and buried
it forever from polite usage.</p>

<p>In another respect, also, this New
England spinster grew into a being such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
as the world had not seen. It is difficult
of explanation. Perhaps most easily
said, it is this: she never by any motion
or phrase suggested to a man her variation
from him. All over the world
women do this; unconsciously nearly
always; in New England never. The
expression of the woman has there been
condemned as immodest, unwomanly,
and with fierce invective; the expression
of the man been lauded. Das Ewig-Weibliche
must persist without confession
of its existence. In the common
conception, when among masculine comrades
she should bear herself as a sexless
sort of half-being, an hermaphroditic
comrade, a weaker, unsexed
creature, not markedly masculine, like
her brother or the present golfing
woman, and far from positively feminine.</p>

<p>All her ideals were masculine; that
is, all concrete and human expression of
an ideal life set before her was masculine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
Her religion was wholly masculine,
and God was always “He.” Her art in
its later phases was at its height in the
“Spectator” and “Tatler,” where the
smirking belles who matched the bewigged
beaux of Anne’s London are
jeered at, and conviction is carried the
woman reader that all her sex expressions
are if not foul, fool, and sometimes
both fool and foul.</p>

<p>In this non-recognition of a woman’s
sex, its needs and expression in home
and family life, and in the domination of
masculine ideals, has been a loss of
grace, facile touch in manner, vivacity,
légèreté; in short, a want of clarity,
delicacy, and feminine strength. To put
the woman’s sex aside and suppress it
was to emphasize spinster life&mdash;and increase
it. It is this nullification of her
sex traits that has led the world to say
the New England woman is masculine,
when the truth is she is most femininely
feminine in everything but sex&mdash;where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
she is most femininely and self-effacingly
<i>it</i>.</p>

<p>It is in this narrowness, this purity,
simplicity, and sanctity, in this circumspection
and misdirection, that we have
the origin of the New England woman’s
subjectivity, her unconscious self-consciousness,
and that seeming hermaphroditic
attitude that has attracted the
attention of the world, caused its wonder,
and led to its false judgment of her
merit.</p>

<p>Social changes&mdash;a result of the Zeitgeist&mdash;within
the last two generations
have brought a broadening of the conception
of the “sphere” of women.
Puritan instincts have been dying. Rationalism
has to a degree been taking
their place. While, on the other hand,&mdash;one
may say this quite apart from construing
the galvanic twitchings of a revived
mediævalism in ecclesiastic and
other social affairs as real life&mdash;there
have also come conceptions of the liberty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
and dignity of womanhood, independent
or self-dependent, beyond those
which prevailed in the nunnery world.</p>

<p>A popular feeling has been growing
that a woman’s sphere is whatever she
can do excellently. What effect this
will have on social relations at large we
cannot foresee. From such conditions
another chivalry may spring! What
irony of history if on New England
soil!! Possibly, the custom that now
pertains of paying women less than men
for the same work, the habit in all businesses
of giving women the drudging
details,&mdash;necessary work, indeed, but
that to which no reputation is affixed,&mdash;and
giving to men the broader tasks in
which there is contact with the world
and the result of contact, growth, may
ultimately react, just as out of injustice
and brutalities centuries ago arose a
chivalrous ideal and a knightly redresser.</p>

<p>The sparseness of wealth, the meagreness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
of material ideals, and the frugality,
simplicity, and rusticity of New
England life have never allowed a development
of popular manners. Grace
among the people has been interpreted
theologically; never socially. Their
geniality, like their sunshine, has always
had a trace of the northeast wind&mdash;chilled
by the Labrador current of their
theology. Native wit has been put out
by narrow duties. The conscience of
their theology has been instinctively for
segregation, never for social amalgamation.
They are more solitary than gregarious.</p>

<p>We should expect, then, an abruptness
of manner among those left to develop
social genius&mdash;the women&mdash;even
among those travelled and most generously
educated. We should expect a
degree of baldness and uncoveredness
in their social processes, which possibly
might be expressed by the polysyllable
which her instructor wrote at the end
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
of a Harvard Annex girl’s theme to express
its literary quality, “unbuttoned”&mdash;unconsciously.</p>

<p>When you meet the New England
woman, you see her placing you in her
social scale. That in tailor-making you
God may have used a yardstick different
from the New England measure has
not yet reached her consciousness; nor
that the system of weights and measures
of what Sir Leslie Stephen calls “the
half-baked civilization of New England”
may not prevail in all towns and countries.
Should you chance not to fit any
notch she has cut in her scale, she is apt
to tell you this in a raucous, strident
voice, with a schoolma’am air in delivery
of her opinion. If she is untravelled
and purely of New England surroundings,
these qualities may be accented.
She is undeniably frank and unquestionably
truthful. At all times, in centuries
past and to-day, she would scorn such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
lies as many women amazingly tell for
amusement or petty self-defence.</p>

<p>It is evident that she is a good deal of
a fatalist. This digression will illustrate:
If you protest your belief that so
far as this world’s estimate goes some
great abilities have no fair expression,
that in our streets we jostle mute inglorious
Miltons; if you say you have
known most profound and learned
natures housed on a Kansas farm or in
a New Mexico cañon; nay, if you aver
your faith that here in New England
men and women of genius are unnoticed
because Messrs. Hue and Cry, voicing
the windier, have not appreciated larger
capacities, she will pityingly tell you
that this larger talent is supposititious.
If it were real, she continues, it must
have risen to sight and attracted the
eye of men. Her human knowledge is
not usually deep nor her insight subtle,
and she does not know that in saying
this she is contradicting the law of literary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
history, that the producers of permanent
intellectual wares are often not
recognized by their contemporaries, nor
run after by mammonish publishers.
And at last, when you answer that the
commonest question with our humankind
is nourishment for the body, that
ease and freedom from exhausting
labor must forerun education, literature,
art, she retorts that here is proof she is
right: if these unrecognized worthies
you instance had the gifts you name,
they would be superior to mere physical
wants.</p>

<p>If you have longanimity, you do not
drive the generality closer; you drown
your reflections in Sir Thomas Browne:
“The iniquity of oblivion blindly scattereth
her poppy and deals with the
memory of men without distinction to
merit of perpetuity.... Who knows
whether the best of men be known, or
whether there be not more remarkable
persons forgot than any that stand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
remembered in the known account of
time?”</p>

<p>Her narrow fatalism, united with the
conservatism and aristocratic instincts
common to all women from their retired
life and ignorance of their kind, gives
the New England woman a hedged sympathy
with the proletarian struggle for
freer existence. It may be lack of comprehension
rather than lack of sympathy.
She would cure by palliations, a
leprosy by healing divers sores. At
times you find her extolling the changes
wrought in the condition of women during
the last seventy years. She argues
for the extension of education; her conservatism
admits that. She may not
draw the line of her radicalism even
before enfranchisement. But the vaster
field of the education of the human race
by easier social conditions, by lifting
out of money worship and egoism,&mdash;this
has never been, she argues, and therefore
strenuously insists it never will be.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>Her civic spirit is Bostonesque. A
town’s spirit is a moral and spiritual
attitude impressed upon members of a
community where events have engendered
unity of sentiment, and it commonly
subordinates individual idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>The spirit Boston presents includes a
habit of mind apparently ratiocinative,
but once safely housed in its ism incredulously
conservative and persistently
self-righteous&mdash;lacking flexibility.
Within its limits it is as fixed as the
outline of the Common. It has externally
a concession and docility. It is
polite and kind&mdash;but when its selfishness
is pressing its greediness is of the
usurious lender. In our generation it
is marked by lack of imagination, originality,
initiative. Having had its origin
in Non-conformity, it has the habit of
seeing what it is right for others to do
to keep their house clean&mdash;pulling down
its mouth when the rest of the world
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
laughs, square-toeing when the rest trip
lightly, straight-lacing when the other
human is erring, but all the time carrying
a heart under its east-wind stays,
and eyes which have had a phenomenal
vision for right and wrong doing&mdash;for
others’ wrongdoing especially; yet
withal holding under its sour gravity
moral impulses of such import that they
have leavened the life of our country
to-day and rebuked and held in check
easier, lighter, less profound, less illuminated,
less star-striking ideals.</p>

<p>It is a spirit featured not unsimilarly
to the Lenox landscape&mdash;safe, serene,
inviting, unable in our day to produce
great crop without the introduction of
fresh material&mdash;and from like cause. A
great glacier has pressed on both human
spirit and patch of earth. But the
sturdy, English bedrock of the immaterial
foundation was not by the glacier
of Puritanism so smoothed, triturated,
and fertilized as was Berkshire soil by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
the pulverizing weight of its titanic ice
flow.</p>

<p>This spirit is also idealistic outside its
civic impulses,&mdash;referring constantly to
the remote past or future,&mdash;and in its
eyes the abstract is apt to be as real as
the concrete. To this characteristic is
due not only Emersonism and Alcottism&mdash;really
old Platonism interpreted for
the transcendental Yankee&mdash;but also
that faith lately revivified, infinitely vulgarized,
as logically distorted as the
pneuma doctrine of the first century,
and called “Christian Science.” The
idealism of Emerson foreran the dollar-gathering
idealism of Mrs. Mary Baker
Eddy as the lark of spring foreruns the
maple worm.</p>

<p>This idealism oftenest takes religious
phases&mdash;as in its Puritan origin&mdash;and in
many instances in our day is content
with crude expression. Of foregone
days evidence is in an incomplete list&mdash;only
twenty-five&mdash;of Brigham Young’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
wives, some of whom bore such old New
England patronymics as Angell, Adams,
Ross, Lawrence, Bigelow, Snow, Folsom.
May a fleeing of these women to Mormonism
be explained by their impatience
and heart-sickness at their unsexing
social condition and religious spirit?&mdash;with
the admitting to the great scheme
of life and action but one sex and that
the one to which their theocratic theologians
belonged?</p>

<p>Speculations of pure philosophy this
New England woman is inclined to fear
as vicious. In dialectics she rests upon
the glories of the innocuous transcendentalism
of the nineteenth century
forties. Exceptions to this rule are perhaps
those veraciously called “occult;”
for she will run to listen to the juggling
logic and boasting rhetoric of Swamis
Alphadananda and Betadananda and
Gammadananda, and cluster about the
audience-room of those dusky fakirs
much as a swarm of bees flits in May.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
And like the bees, she deserts cells filled
with honey for combs machine-made and
wholly empty.</p>

<p>Illuminated by some factitious light,
she will again go to unheard-of lengths
in extenuating Shelley’s relations to his
wives, and in explaining George Eliot’s
marriage to her first husband. Here,
and for at least once in her life, she combats
convention and reasons upon natural
grounds. “I don’t see the wickedness
of Rudolph,” said one spinster, referring
to the tragedy connecting a
prince of Austria and a lady of the
Vetchera family. “I don’t see why he
shouldn’t have followed his heart. But
I shouldn’t dare say that to any one
else in Boston. Most of them think as
I do, but they would all be shocked to
have it said.”</p>

<p>“Consider the broad meaning of what
you say. Let this instance become a
universal law.”</p>

<p>“Still I believe every sensible man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
and woman applauds Rudolph’s independence.”</p>

<p>With whatsoever or whomsoever she
is in sympathy this woman is apt to be
a partisan. To husband, parents, and
children there could be no more devoted
adherent. Her conscience, developed
by introspective and subjective pondering,
has for her own actions abnormal
size and activity. It is always alert,
always busy, always prodding, and not
infrequently sickened by its congested
activity. Duty to those about her, and
industry for the same beneficiaries, are
watchwords of its strength; and to fail
in a mote’s weight is to gain condemnation
of two severest sorts&mdash;her own
and the community’s. The opinion of
the community in which she lives is her
second almighty power.</p>

<p>In marriage she often exemplifies that
saying of Euripides which Stobæus has
preserved among the lavender-scented
leaves of his Florilegium&mdash;“A sympathetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
wife is a man’s best possession.”
She has mental sympathy&mdash;a result of
her tense nervous organization, her
altruism in domestic life, her strong
love, and her sense of duty, justice, and
right.</p>

<p>In body she belongs to a people which
has spent its physical force and depleted
its vitality. She is slight. There is lack
of adipose tissue, reserve force, throughout
her frame. Her lungs are apt to be
weak, waist normal, and hips undersized.</p>

<p>She is awkward in movement. Her
climate has not allowed her relaxation,
and the ease and curve of motion that
more enervating air imparts. This is
seen even in public. In walking she
holds her elbows set in an angle, and
sometimes she steps out in the tilt of the
Cantabrigian man. In this is perhaps
an unconscious imitation, a sympathetic
copying, of an admirable norm; but it
is graceless in petticoats. As she steps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
she knocks her skirt with her knees, and
gives you the impression that her leg is
crooked, that she does not lock her knee-joint.
More often she toes in than out.</p>

<p>She has a marvellously delicate, brilliant,
fine-grained skin. It is innocent
of powder and purely natural. No beer
in past generations has entered its
making, and no port; also, little flesh.
In New England it could not be said, as
a London writer has coarsely put it,
that a woman may be looked upon as an
aggregate of so many beefsteaks.</p>

<p>Her eyes have a liquid purity and preternatural
brightness; she is the child
of γλαυχῶπις Athena, rather than of βοῶπις
Hera, Pronuba, and ministress to women
of more luxuriant flesh. The brown of
her hair inclines to the ash shades.</p>

<p>Her features would in passport wording
be called “regular.” The expression
of her face when she lives in more
prosperous communities, where salaries
are and an assured future, is a stereotyped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
smile. In more uncertain life and
less fortunate surroundings, her countenance
shows a weariness of spirit and
a homesickness for heaven that make
your soul ache.</p>

<p>Her mind is too self-conscious on the
one hand, and too set on lofty duties on
the other, to allow much of coquetterie,
or flirting, or a femininely accented
camaraderie with men&mdash;such as the
more elemental women of Chicago, Cincinnati,
San Francisco, and New York
enjoy. She is farthest possible from
the luxuriant beauty of St. Louis who
declared, “You bet! black-jack-diamond
kind of a time!” when asked if she had
enjoyed her social dash in Newport.
This New England woman would, forsooth,
take no dash in Aurovulgus. But
falling by chance among vulgarities and
iniquities, she guards against the defilement
of her lips, for she loves a pure
and clean usage of our facile English
speech.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

<p>The old phase of the New England
woman is passing. It is the hour for
some poet to voice her threnody. Social
conditions under which she developed
are almost obliterated. She is already
outnumbered in her own home by women
of foreign blood, an ampler physique,
a totally different religious conception,
a far different conduct; and a less exalted
ideal of life. Intermixtures will
follow and racial lines gradually fade.
In the end she will not be. Her passing
is due to the unnumbered husbandless
and the physical attenuation of the married&mdash;attenuation
resulting from their
spare and meagre diet, and, it is also
claimed, from the excessive household
labor of their mothers. More profoundly
causative&mdash;in fact, inciting the
above conditions&mdash;was the distorted
morality and debilitating religion impressed
upon her sensitive spirit. Mayhap
in this present decay some Mœra
is punishing that awful crime of self-sufficing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
ecclesiasticism. Her unproductivity&mdash;no
matter from what reason,
whether from physical necessity or a
spirit-searching flight from the wrath of
God&mdash;has been her death.

<h2 id="A_NEW_ENGLAND_ABODE_OF_THE_BLESSED">A NEW ENGLAND ABODE
OF THE BLESSED</h2>

<p>Upon the broad level of one of our
Litchfield hills is&mdash;if we accept ancient
legend&mdash;a veritable Island of the
Blessed. There heroes fallen after
strong fight enjoy rest forever.</p>

<p>The domination of unyielding law in
the puny affairs of men&mdash;the unfathomableness
of Mœra, the lot no man can
escape&mdash;comes upon one afresh upon
this hill-top. What clay we are in the
hands of fate! “ἅπαντα τíχτει χθὼν πάλιν τε
λαμβáνει,” cried Euripides&mdash;“all things
the earth puts forth and takes again.”</p>

<p>But why should the efforts of men to
build a human hive have here been
wiped away&mdash;here where all nature is
wholesome and in seeming unison with
regulated human life? The air sparkles
buoyantly up to your very eyes&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
almost intoxicates you with its life
and joy. Through its day-translucence
crows cut their measured flight and
brisker birds flitter, and when the young
moon shines out of a warm west elegiac
whippoorwills cry to the patient night.</p>

<p>Neither volcanic ashes nor flood,
whirlwind nor earthquake&mdash;mere decay
has here nullified men’s efforts for congregated
life and work. The soil of the
hill, porous and sandy, is of moderate
fertility. Native oaks and chestnuts,
slender birches and fragrant hemlocks,
with undergrowths of coral-flowering
laurel, clothe its slopes. Over its sandstone
ledges brooks of soft water treble
minor airs&mdash;before they go loitering
among succulent grasses and spearmint
and other thirsty brothers of the distant
meadows.</p>

<p>Nearly two hundred years ago pioneers
of a Roundhead, independent type&mdash;the
type which led William of Orange
across the Channel for preservation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
that liberty which Englishmen for hundreds
of years had spoken of as “antient”&mdash;such
men broke this sod, till
then untouched by axe or plough. They
made clearings, and grouped their
hand-hewn houses just where in cool
mornings of summer they could see the
mists roll up from their hill-locked pond
to meet the rosy day; just where, when
the sun sank behind the distant New
York mountains, they could catch within
their windows his last shaft of gold.</p>

<p>Here they laid their hearths and dwelt
in primitive comfort. Their summers
were unspeakably beautiful&mdash;and hard-working.
Their autumns indescribably
brilliant, hill-side and valley uniting to
form a radiance God’s hand alone could
hold. Their winters were of deep snows
and cold winds and much cutting and
burning of wood. The first voice of
their virid spring came in the bird-calls
of early March, when snow melted and
sap mounted, and sugar maples ran
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
syrup; when ploughs were sharpened,
and steaming and patient oxen rested
their sinews through the long, pious
Sabbath.</p>

<p>Wandering over this village site, now
of fenced-in fields, you find here and
there a hearth and a few cobbles piled
above it. The chimney-shaft has long
since disappeared. You happen upon
stone curbs, and look down to the dark
waters of wells. You come upon bushes
of old-fashioned, curled-petal, pink-sweet
roses and snowy phlox, and upon
tiger lilies flaunting odalisque faces before
simple sweetbrier, and upon many
another garden plant which “a handsome
woman that had a fine hand”&mdash;as
Izaak Walton said of her who made the
trout fly&mdash;once set as border to her path.
Possibly the very hand that planted
these pinks held a bunch of their sweetness
after it had grown waxen and cold.
The pinks themselves are now choked by
the pushing grass.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<p>And along this line of gooseberry-bushes
we trace a path from house to
barn. Here was the fireplace. The
square of small boulders yonder marks
the barn foundation. Along this path
the house-father bore at sunrise and
sunset his pails of foaming milk. Under
that elm spreading between living-room
and barn little children of the family
built pebble huts, in these rude confines
cradling dolls which the mother had
made from linen of her own weave, or
the father whittled when snow had
crusted the earth and made vain all his
hauling and digging.</p>

<p>Those winters held genial hours.
Nuts from the woods and cider from the
orchard stood on the board near by.
Home-grown wood blazed in the chimney;
home-grown chestnuts, hidden in
the ashes by busy children, popped to
expectant hands; house-mothers sat
with knitting and spinning, and the
father and farm-men mended fittings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
and burnished tools for the spring work.
Outside the stars glittered through a
clear sky and the soundless earth below
lay muffled in sleep.</p>

<p>Over yonder across the road was the
village post-office, and not far away
were stores of merchant supplies. But
of these houses no vestige now remains.
Where the post-house stood the earth is
matted with ground-pine and gleaming
with scarlet berries of the wintergreen.
The wiping-out is as complete as that of
the thousand trading-booths, long since
turned to clay, of old Greek Mycenæ, or
of the stalls of the ancient trading-folk
dwelling between Jaffa and Jerusalem
where Tell-ej-Jezari now lies.</p>

<p>The church of white clap-boards which
these villagers used for praise and
prayer&mdash;not a small temple&mdash;still abides.
Many of the snowy houses of old New
England worship pierce their luminous
ether with graceful spires. But this
meeting-house lifts a square, central
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
bell-tower which now leans on one side
as if weary with long standing. The old
bell which summoned its people to their
pews still hangs behind green blinds&mdash;a
not unmusical town-crier. But use,
life, good works have departed with
those whom it exhorted to church duty,
and in sympathy with all the human
endeavor it once knew, but now fordone,
in these days it never rings blithely, it
can only be made to toll. Possibly it
can only be made to toll because of the
settling of its supporting tower. But
the fact remains; and who knows if
some wounded spirit may not be dwelling
within its brazen curves, sick at
heart with its passing and ineffective
years?</p>

<p>Not far from the church, up a swell
of the land, lies the burying-ground&mdash;a
sunny spot. Pines here and there, also
hemlocks and trees which stand bare
after the fall of leaves. But all is bright
and open, not a hideous stone-quarry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
such as in our day vanity or untaught
taste makes of resting-places of our
dead. Gay-colored mushrooms waste
their luxurious gaudiness between the
trees, and steadfast myrtle, with an
added depth to its green from the air’s
clarity, binds the narrow mounds with
ever-lengthening cords.</p>

<p>But whether they are purple with
the violets of May or with Michaelmas
daisies, there is rest over all these
mounds&mdash;“über allen Gipfeln ist Ruh’.”
Daily gossip and sympathy these neighbors
had. The man of this grave was he
who passed many times a day up and
down the path by the gooseberry-bushes
and bore the foaming milk. He is as
voiceless now as the flies that buzzed
about his shining pail. And the widow
who dwelt across the road&mdash;she of the
sad eyes who sat always at her loom, for
her youthful husband was of those who
never came back from the massacre of
Fort William Henry&mdash;she to whom this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
man hauled a sled of wood for every two
he brought to his own door, to whom his
family carried elderberry wine, cider,
and home mince-meat on Thanksgiving&mdash;she,
too, is voiceless even of thanks,
her body lying over yonder, now in complete
rest&mdash;no loom, no treadle, no
thumping, no whirring of spinning-wheel,
no narrow pinching and poverty,
her soul of heroic endurance joined with
her long separate soldier soul of action.</p>

<p>The pathos of their lives and the
warmth of their humanity!&mdash;however
coated with New England austerity.
Many touching stories these little headstones
tell&mdash;as this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To the memory of Mrs. Abigail, Consort of
Mr. Joseph Merrill, who died May 3rd, 1767, in
the 52 year of her age.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A consort in royal dignity and poetry
is a sharer of one’s lot. Mr. Joseph
Merrill had no acquaintance with the
swagger and pretension of courts, and
he knew no poetry save his hill-side,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
his villagers, and the mighty songs of
the Bible. He was a plain, simple,
Yankee husbandman, round-shouldered
from carrying heavy burdens, coarse-handed
from much tilling of the earth
and use of horse and cattle. While he
listened to sermons in the white church
down the slope, his eyes were often
heavy for need of morning sleep; and
many a Sunday his back and knees ached
from lack of rest as he stood beside the
sharer of his fortunes in prayer. Yet
his simple memorial warms the human
heart one hundred and thirty-eight
years after his “consort” had for the
last time folded her housewifely hands.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Of sa great faith and charitie,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With mutuall love and amitie:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That I wat an mair heavenly life,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Was never betweene man and wife.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was doubtless with Master Merrill
as with the subject of an encomium of
Charles Lamb’s. “Though bred a Presbyterian,”
says Lamb of Joseph Paice,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
“and brought up a merchant, he was the
finest gentleman of his time.”</p>

<p>In May, 1767, when this sharer of
humble fortune lay down to rest, the
Stamp Act had been repealed but fourteen
months. The eyes of the world
were upon Pitt and Burke and Townshend&mdash;and
Franklin whose memorable
examination before the House of Commons
was then circulating as a news
pamphlet. The social gossip of the day&mdash;as
Lady Sarah Lennox’s wit recounts&mdash;had
no more recognition of the villagers
than George the Fourth.</p>

<p>But American sinews and muscles
such as these hidden on the Litchfield
Hills were growing in daily strength
by helpful, human exercise, and their
“well-lined braine” was reasoning upon
the Declaratory Act that “Parliament
had power to bind the colonies in all
cases whatsoever.”</p>

<p>Another stone a few paces away has
quite another story:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Here lies the body of Mr. Stephen Kelsey, who<br /></span>
<span class="i2">died April 2, 1745, in y<sup>e</sup> 71 year of his age<br /></span>
<span class="i12">as you are so was we<br /></span>
<span class="i12">as we are you must be”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The peculiarities of this inscription
were doubtless the stone-cutter’s; and
peradventure it was in the following
way that the rhymes&mdash;already centuries
old in 1745 when Stephen Kelsey died&mdash;came
to be upon his headstone.</p>

<p>The carver of the memorial was undeniably
a neighbor and fellow-husbandman
to the children of Mr. Stephen
Kelsey. Money-earning opportunities
were narrow and silver hard to come by
in the pioneering of the Litchfield Hills,
and only after scrupulous saving had
the Kelsey family the cost of the headstone
at last in hand. It was then that
they met to consider an epitaph.</p>

<p>Their neighbor bespoken to work the
stone was at the meeting, and to open
the way and clear his memory he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
scratched the date of death upon a tablet
or shingle his own hand had riven.</p>

<p>“Friend Stephen’s death,” he began,
“calleth to mind a verse often sculptured
in the old church-yard in Leicestershire,
a verse satisfying the soul with
the vanity of this life, and turning our
eyes to the call from God which is to
come. It toucheth not the vexations of
the world which it were vain to deny are
ever present. You carry it in your
memory mayhap, Mistress Remembrance?”
the stone-master interrupting
himself asked, suddenly appealing to a
sister of Master Kelsey.</p>

<p>Mistress Remembrance, an elderly
spinster whose lover having in their
youth taken the great journey to New
York, and crossed the Devil’s Stepping-Stones&mdash;which
before the memory of
man some netherworld force laid an
entry of Manhattan Island&mdash;had never
again returned to the Litchfield Hills&mdash;Mistress
Remembrance recalled the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
verses, and also her brother, Master
Stephen’s, sonorous repetition of them.</p>

<p>In this way it came about that
the mourning family determined they
should be engraven. And there the lines
stand to-day in the hills’ beautiful air&mdash;far
more than a century since the hour
when Mistress Remembrance and the
stone-cutter joined the celestial choir in
which Master Stephen was that very
evening singing.</p>

<p>But another headstone&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture decked”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>quite outdoes Master Kelsey’s in
strange English phrase. It reads:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">“Michel son of John Spencer<br /></span>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>And still another perpetuates the
record of the same family:</p>

born a woman! Or did the
parents embody in the name their own
spiritual history of resignation to the
eternal powers?&mdash;“to fill this narrow
space, in yonder house made a vast

<p>Farther up the slope of this God’s

<p>Every village has its tragedy, alas!
and that recounted in this following inscription
is at least one faithful record
of terrifying disaster. Again it seems at
variance with the moral order of the
world that these quiet fields should witness
the terror this tiny memorial hints
at. The stone is quite out of plumb and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
moss-covered, but underneath the lichen
it reads:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Phebe, wife of Ezekiel Markham Died Jyly 14,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">1806 Ae 49<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also their 3 Sons Bela, Ciba, and Brainad was<br /></span>
<span class="i9">burnt to Death in Oct 1793”<br /></span>
<span class="i7">“In the midst of life we are dead”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The mother lived nearly thirteen
years after. There is no neighboring
record of the father. Perhaps the two
migrated after the fearful holocaust,
and he only returned to place his wife’s
body beside the disfigured remains of
her little ungrown men. Bela, Ciba, and
Brainard rested lonesomely doubtless
those thirteen waiting years, and many
a night must their little ghosts have sat
among the windflowers and hepaticas of
spring, or wandered midst the drifted
needles of the pines in the clear moonlight
of summer, athirst for the mother’s
soul of comfort and courage.</p>

<p>Again in this intaglio “spelt by th’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
unlettered Muse” rises the question of
the stone-cutter’s knowledge of his
mother tongue. The church of the dead
villagers still abides. But nowhere are
seen the remains of a school-house.
Descendants of the cutter of Master
Kelsey’s headstone haply had many
orders.</p>

<p>The sun of Indian summer upon the
fallen leaves brings out their pungent
sweetness. Except the blossoms of the
subtle witch-hazel all the flowers are
gone. The last fringed gentian fed by
the oozing spring down the hill-side
closed its blue cup a score of days ago.
Every living thing rests. The scene is
filled with a strange sense of waiting.
And above is the silence of the sky.</p>

<p>With such influences supervening
upon their lives, these people of the
early village&mdash;undisturbed as they were
by any world call, and gifted with a
fervid and patient faith&mdash;must daily
have grown in consciousness of a homely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
Presence ever reaching under their mortality
the Everlasting Arm.</p>

<p>This potency abides, its very feeling
is in the air above these graves&mdash;that
some good, some divine is impendent&mdash;that
the soul of the world is outstretching
a kindred hand.</p>

<p>In the calm and other-worldliness of
their hill-top the eternal moralities of
the Deuteronomy and of Sophocles stand
clearer to human vision&mdash;the good that
is mighty and never grows gray,&mdash;μέγας
ἐν τούτοις θεὸς, οὐδὲ γηράσχει.</p>

<p>The comings and goings, the daily
labors, the hopes and interests of these
early dwellers make an unspeakable
appeal&mdash;their graves in the church-yard,
the ruined foundations of their domestic
life beyond&mdash;that their output of lives
and years of struggle bore no more lasting
local fruit, however their seed may
now be scattered to the upbuilding of
our South and West, the conversion of
China, and our ordering of the Philippines.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>And yet, although their habitations
are fallen, they&mdash;such men and women
as they&mdash;still live. Their hearts, hands,
and heads are in all institutions of ours
that are free. A great immortality,
surely! If such men and women had
been less severe, less honest, less gifted
for conditions barren of luxuries, less
elevated with an enthusiasm for justice,
less clear in their vision of the eternal
moralities, less simple and direct, less
worthy inheritors of the great idea of
liberty which inflamed generations of
their ancestors, it is not possible that
we should be here to-day doing our work
to keep what they won and carry their
winnings further. Their unswerving
independence in thought and action and
their conviction that the finger of God
pointed their way&mdash;their theocratic
faith, their lifted sense of God-leading&mdash;made
possible the abiding of their
spirit long after their material body lay
spent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>

<p>So it is that upon the level top of the
Litchfield Hills&mdash;what with the decay of
the material things of life and the divine
permanence of the spiritual&mdash;there is a
resting-place of the Blessed&mdash;an Island
of the Blessed as the old Greeks used
to say&mdash;an abode of heroes fallen after
strong fighting and enjoying rest forever.

<p>“I hate every woman!” cries Euripides,
in keen iambics in a citation of
the Florilegium of Stobæus. The sentiment
was not new with Euripides&mdash;unfortunately.
Before him there was
bucolic Hesiod with his precepts on
wife-choosing. There was Simonides
of Amorgos, who in outcrying the degradation
of the Ionian women told the
degradation of the Ionian men. There
was Hipponax, who fiercely sang “two
days on which a woman gives a man
most pleasure&mdash;the day he marries her
and the day he buries her.”</p>

<p>And along with Euripides was Aristophanes,
the radiant laughter-lover,
the titanic juggler with the heavens
above and earth and men below&mdash;Aristophanes
who flouted the women of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
Athens in his “Ecclesiazusæ,” and in
the “Clouds” and his “Thesmophoriazusæ.”
Thucydides before them had
named but one woman in his whole
great narrative, and had avoided the
mention of women and their part in the
history he relates.</p>

<p>“Woman is a curse!” cried Susarion.
The Jews had said it before, when they
told the story of Eve&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Of man’s first disobedience, and the fruit<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Brought death into the world, and all our woe.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Down through many centuries our
forebears cast to and fro the same sentiment&mdash;in
spite of the introduction into
life and literature of the love of men
for women and women for men; in spite
of the growth of romantic love. You
find misogynous expression among the
Latins. In early “Church Fathers,”
such as St. John Chrysostom, you come
upon it in grossest form. Woman is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
“a necessary ill,” cried the Golden
Mouthed, “a natural temptation, a
wished-for calamity, a household danger,
a deadly fascination, a bepainted
evil.”</p>

<p>You see the sentiment in the laws of
church and of kingdom. You sight its
miasm in the gloaming and murk of the
Middle Ages, amid the excesses which in
shame for it chivalry affected and exalted.
You read it by the light of the
awful fires that burnt women accessory
to the husband’s crime&mdash;for which their
husbands were merely hanged. You see
it in Martin Luther’s injunction to
Catherine von Bora that it ill became
his wife to fasten her waist in front&mdash;because
independence in women is unseemly,
their dress should need an
assistant for its donning. You chance
upon it in old prayers written by men,
and once publicly said by men for English
queens to a God “which for the
offence of the first woman hast threatened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
unto all women a common, sharp,
and inevitable malediction.”</p>

<p>You find the sentiment in Boileau’s
satire and in Pope’s “Characters.”
You open the pages of the Wizard of
the North, who did for his own generations
what Heliodorus and his chaste
Chariclea accomplished for the fourth
century, and you come upon Walter
Scott singing in one of his exquisite
songs&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Woman’s faith, and woman’s trust,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Write the characters in dust.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>All such sad evidences, it should be
borne in mind, are but the reverse of
the fair picture with which men have
regarded women. But because there is
a reverse side, and its view has entered
and still enters largely into human life,
human estimates, and human fate, it
should be spoken about openly. Women
and men inexperienced in the outer
world of affairs do not realize its still
potent force.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p>As for the subject of these gibes, for
ages they were silent. During many
generations, in the privacy of their
apartments, the women must have made
mute protests to one another. “These
things are false,” their souls cried.
But they took the readiest defence of
physical weakness, and they loved harmony.
It was better to be silent than
to rise in bold proof of an untruth and
meet rude force.</p>

<p>Iteration and dogmatic statement of
women’s moral inferiority, coupled as
it often was with quoted text and
priestly authority, had their inevitable
effect upon more sensitive and introspective
characters; it humiliated and
unquestionably deprived many a woman
of self-respect. Still, all along there
must have been a less sensitive, sturdier,
womanhood possessed of the perversive
faith of Mrs. Poyser, that “heaven
made ’em to match the men,” that&mdash;<br />

<span class="caption">“Together, dwarfed or godlike, bond or free,”&mdash;</span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
men and women rise or sink; that, in
fact, the interests of the two are inseparable
and wholly identical. To broad
vision misogynous expression seems to
set in antagonism forces united by all
the mighty powers of human evolution
throughout millions of years, and the
whole plan of God back of that soul-unfolding.</p>

<p>The misogynous song and story of
our forebears with momentous fall descended
and became the coarse newspaper
quip which a generation ago
whetted its sting upon women&mdash;“Susan
B. Anthonys”&mdash;outspoken and seeking
more freedom than social prejudices of
their day allowed. An annoying gnat,
it has in these days been almost exterminated
by diffusion of the oil of fairness
and better knowledge.</p>

<p>But even yet periodicals at times give
mouth to the old misogyny. Such an
expression, nay, two, are published in
otherwise admirable pages, and with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
these we have to do. They are from the
pen of a man of temperament, energy,
vigorous learning, and an “esurient
Genie” for books&mdash;professor of Latin
in one of our great universities, where
misogynous sentiment has found expression
in lectures in course and also in
more public delivery.</p>

<p>The first reverse phrase is of “the
neurotic caterwauling of an hysterical
woman.” Cicero’s invective and pathos
are said to be perilously near that perturbance.</p>

<p>Now specialists in nervous difficulties
have not yet determined there is marked
variation between neurotic caterwauling
of hysterical women and neurotic caterwauling
of hysterical men. Cicero’s
shrieks&mdash;for Cicero was what is to-day
called “virile,” “manly,” “strenuous,”
“vital”&mdash;Cicero’s would naturally approximate
the men’s.</p>

<p>To normally tuned ears caterwaulings
are as unagreeable as misogynous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
whoops&mdash;waulings of men as cacophonous
as waulings of women. Take an
instance in times foregone. In what is
the megalomaniac whine of Marie Bashkirtseff’s
“Journal” more unagreeable
than the egotistical vanity of Lord
Byron’s wails? Each of these pen people
may be viewed from another point.
More generously any record&mdash;even an
academic misogyny&mdash;is of interest and
value because expressing the idiosyncratic
development or human feeling of
the world.</p>

<p>But, exactly and scientifically speaking,
neurotic and hysteric are contradictory
terms. Neurotic men and
women are described by physicians as
self-forgetting sensitives&mdash;zealous, executive;
while the hysterics of both
sexes are supreme egotists, selfish, vain,
and vague, uncomfortable both in personal
and literary contact&mdash;just like wit
at their expense. “If we knew all,”
said George Eliot, who was never hysterical,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
“we would not judge.” And
Paul of Tarsus wrote wisely to those
of Rome, “Therefore thou art inexcusable,
O man, whosoever thou art, that
judgest.”</p>

<p>Science nowadays declares that the
man who wears a shirt-collar cannot be
well, and equally the same analytic
spirit may some day make evident that
neurosis and hysteria are legacies of
a foredone generation, who found the
world out of joint and preyed upon its
strength and calmness of nerve to set
things right. Humaneness and fair estimate
are remedies to-day’s dwellers
upon the earth can offer, whether the
neurosis and hysteria be Latin or Saxon,
men’s or indeed women’s.</p>

<p>The second of the phrases to which
we adverted tells of “the unauthoritative
young women who make dictionaries
at so much a mile.” It has the
smack of the wit of the eighteenth century&mdash;of
Pope’s studied and never-ceasing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
gibes at Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu after she had given him the
mitten; of Dr. Johnson’s “female day”
and his rumbling thunder over “the
freaks and humors and spleen and
vanity of women”&mdash;he of all men who
indulge in freaks and humors and spleen
and vanity!&mdash;whose devotion to his bepainted
and bedizened old wife was the
talk of their literary London.</p>

<p>We are apt to believe the slurs that
Pope, Johnson, and their self-applauding
colaborers cast upon what they commonly
termed “females” as deterrent to
their fairness, favor, and fame. The
high-noted laugh which sounded from
Euphelia’s morning toilet and helped
the self-gratulation of those old beaux
not infrequently grates upon our twentieth
century altruistic, neurotic sensibilities.</p>

<p>But to return to our lamb. An unauthoritative
young woman, we suppose,
is one who is not authoritative, who has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
not authority. But what confers authority?
Assumption of it? Very rarely
anything else&mdash;even in the case of a college
professor. We have in our blessed
democracy no Academy, no Sanhedrim,
no keeper of the seal of authority&mdash;and
while we have not we keep life, strength,
freedom in our veins. The young
woman “who makes dictionaries at so
much a mile” may be&mdash;sometimes is&mdash;as
fitted for authority and the exercise
of it as her brother. Academic as well
as popular prejudices, both springing
mainly from the masculine mind, make
him a college professor, and her a
nameless drudge exercising the qualities
women have gained from centuries
of women’s life&mdash;sympathetic service
with belittling recognition of their
work, self-sacrifice, and infinite care
and patience for detail.</p>

<p>Too many of our day, both of men
and women, still believe with old John
Knox&mdash;to glance back even beyond Johnson
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
and Pope&mdash;and his sixteenth century
“First Blast of the Trumpet
against the Monstrous Regiment of
Women”&mdash;a fine example of hysterical
shrieking in men, by the way. With the
loving estimate of Knox’s contemporary,
Mr. John Davidson, we heartily
agree when he sings&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“For weill I wait that Scotland never bure,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In Scottis leid ane man mair Eloquent,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Into perswading also I am sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Was nane in Europe that was mair potent.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In Greik and Hebrew he was excellent,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And als in Latine toung his propernes,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Was tryit trym quhen scollers wer present.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bot thir wer nathing till his uprichtnes.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>We admire Knox’s magnificent moral
courage and the fruits of that courage
which the Scots have long enjoyed, and
yet anent the “cursed Jesabel of England,”
the “cruell monstre Marie,”
Knox cries: “To promote a Woman to
beare rule, superiorite, dominion, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
empire ... is repugnant to Nature,
contumelie to God, a thing most contrarious
to his revealed will and approved
ordinance”&mdash;just as if he, John Knox,
knew all about God’s will and Nature’s
designs. What pretence, John! But
John took it upon himself to say he did.
He <i>assumed</i>; and time and events have
proved that it was sheer assumption on
John’s part. I doubt, were he now here,
if he would let a modest, bread-earning
woman even make dictionaries at so
much a mile&mdash;nothing beyond type-writing,
surely. He would probably
assume authority and shriek hysterically
that anything beyond the finger-play of
type-writing is repugnant to Nature and
contrarious to God.</p>

<p>There was a Mrs. John Knox; there
were two in fact&mdash;ribs.</p>

<p>“That servent faithfull servand of
the Lord” took the first slip of a girl
when near his fiftieth year, long after he
had left the celibate priesthood; and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
second, a lass of sixteen, when he was
fifty-nine. They took care of John, a
mother-in-law helping, and with service
and money gave him leisure to write.
The opinions of the dames do not appear
in their husband’s hysteria. “I use the
help of my left hand,” dictated Knox
when one of these girl-wives was writing
for him a letter.</p>

<p>With the young women we are considering
there is this eternal variation
from John Knox and his hysterical kin,
Celt, Saxon, or Latin&mdash;she does not
assume authority. Consequently she
makes dictionaries at so much a mile.
Such word-spinning was at one time
done by drudge men&mdash;men who had
failed mayhap in the church, or in law,
or had distaste for material developments
or shame for manual work. Now,
with women fortified by the learning
their colleges afford, it is oftenest done
by drudge women. The law of commerce
prevails&mdash;women gain the task
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
because they will take much less a mile
than men. Men offer them less than
they would dare offer a man similarly
equipped.</p>

<p>But why should our brothers who
teach sophomores at so much a year
fleer? even if the woman has got the
job! Does not this arrangement afford
opportunity for a man to affix his name
to her work? In unnumbered&mdash;and concealed&mdash;instances.
We all remember
how in the making of the &mdash;&mdash; dictionary
the unauthoritative woman did the work,
and the unauthoritative man wrote the
introduction, and the authoritative man
affixed his name to it. We all remember
that, surely. Then there is the &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;;
and the &mdash; &mdash;. We do not fear to mention
names, we merely pity and do not&mdash;and
we nurse pity because with Aristotle
we believe that it purifies the heart.
With small knowledge of the publishing
world, I can count five such make-ups as
I here indicate. In one case an authoritative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
woman did her part of the work
under the explicit agreement that her
name should be upon the title-page. In
the end, by a trick, in order to advertise
the man’s, it appeared only in the first
edition. Yet this injustice in nowise deprived
her of a heart of oak.</p>

<p>The commercial book-building world,
as it at present stands&mdash;the place where
they write dictionaries and world’s literatures
at so much a mile&mdash;is apt to
think a woman is out in its turmoil for
her health, or for sheer amusement; not
for the practical reasons men are. An
eminent opinion declared the other day
that they were there “to get a trousseau
or get somebody to get it for ’em.” Another
exalted judgment asserted, “The
first thing they look round the office and
see who there is to marry.”</p>

<p>This same world exploits her labor;
it pays her a small fraction of what it
pays a man engaged in the identical
work; it seizes, appropriates, and sometimes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
grows rich upon her ideas. It
never thinks of advancing her to large
duties because of her efficiency in small.
She is “only a woman,” and with
Ibsen’s great Pillar of Society the business
world thinks she should be “content
to occupy a modest and becoming
position.” The capacities of women
being varied, would not large positions
rightly appear modest and becoming to
large capacities?</p>

<p>For so many centuries men have estimated
a woman’s service of no money
value that it is hard, at the opening of
the twentieth, to believe it equal to even
a small part of a man’s who is doing the
same work. In one late instance a
woman at the identical task of editing
was paid less than one-fortieth the sum
given her colaborer, a man, whose products
were at times submitted to her for
revision and correction. In such cases
the men are virtually devouring the
women&mdash;not quite so openly, yet as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
truly, as the Tierra del Fuegians of
whom Darwin tells: when pressed in
winter by hunger they choke their
women with smoke and eat them. In
our instance just cited the feeding
upon was less patent, but the choking
with smoke equally unconcealed.</p>

<p>The very work of these so-called unauthoritative
women passes in the eyes
of the world uninstructed in the present
artfulness of book-making as the work
of so-called authoritative men. It is
therefore authoritative.</p>

<p>Not in this way did the king-critic get
together his dictionary. Johnson’s work
evidences his hand on every page and
almost in every paragraph. But things
are changed from the good old times of
individual action. We now have literary
trusts and literary monopolies. Nowadays
the duties of an editor-in-chief
may be to oversee each day’s labor, to
keep a sharp eye upon the “authoritative”
men and “unauthoritative”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
women whose work he bargained for at
so much a mile, and, when they finish the
task, to indite his name as chief worker.</p>

<p>Would it be reasonable to suppose
that&mdash;suffering such school-child discipline
and effacement&mdash;those twentieth
century writers nourished the estimate
of “booksellers” with which Michael
Drayton in the seventeenth century
enlivened a letter to Drummond of
Hawthornden?&mdash;“They are a company
of base knives whom I both scorn and
kick at.”</p>

<p>It is under such conditions as that just
cited that we hear a book spoken of as
if it were a piece of iron, not a product
of thought and feeling carefully proportioned
and measured; as if it were the
fruit of a day and not of prolonged
thought and application; as if it could
be easily reproduced by the application
of a mechanical screw; as if it were a
bar of lead instead of far-reaching wings
to minister good; as if it were a thing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
to step upon rather than a thing to reach
to; as if it could be cut, slashed, twisted,
distorted, instead of its really forming
an organic whole with the Aristotelian
breath of unity, and the cutting or hampering
of it would be performing a surgical
operation which might entirely let
out its breath of life.</p>

<p>Until honor is stronger among human
beings&mdash;that is, until the business world
is something other than a maelstrom of
hell&mdash;it is unmanly and unwomanly to
gibe at the “unauthoritative” young
woman writing at so much a mile. She
may be bearing heavy burdens of debt
incurred by another. She may be supporting
a decrepit father or an idle
brother. She is bread-earning. Oftenest
she is gentle, and, like the strapped
dog which licks the hand that lays bare
his brain, she does not strike back. But
she has an inherent sense of honesty and
dishonesty, and she knows what justice
is. Her knowledge of life, the residuum
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
of her unauthoritative literary experience,
shows her the rare insight and
truth of Mr. Howells when he wrote,
“There is <i>no</i> happy life for a woman&mdash;except
as she is happy in suffering for
those she loves, and in sacrificing herself
to their pleasure, their pride, and
ambition. The advantage that the world
offers her&mdash;and it does not always offer
her that&mdash;is her choice in self-sacrifice.”</p>

<p>Ten to one&mdash;a hundred to one&mdash;the
young woman is “unauthoritative” because
she is not peremptory, is not dictatorial,
assumes no airs of authority
such as swelling chest and overbearing
manners, is sympathetic with another’s
egotism, is altruistic, is not egotistical
with the egotism that is unwilling to cast
forth its work for the instructing and
furthering of human kind unless it is
accompanied by the writer’s name&mdash;a
“signed article.” She is not selfish and
guarding the ego. Individual fame
seems to her view an ephemeral thing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
but the aggregate good of mankind for
which she works, eternal.</p>

<p>The beaux of that century of Dr. Johnson’s
were great in spite of their sneers
and taunts at the Clarindas and Euphelias
and Fidelias, not on account of them.
We have no publication which is to our
time as the “Rambler” was to London
in 1753, or the “Spectator,” “Tatler,”
and “Englishman” to Queen Anne’s
earlier day. But in what we have let us
not deface any page with misogynous
phrase and sentence&mdash;jeers or expression
of evil against one-half of humanity.
Unsympathetic words about women who
by some individual fortune have become
literary drudges fit ill American lips&mdash;which
should sing the nobility of any
work that truly helps our kind. These
women go about in wind and rain; they
sit in the foul air of offices; they overcome
repugnance to coarse and familiar
address; they sometimes stint their
food; they are at all times practising a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
close economy; with aching flesh and
nerves they often draw their Saturday
evening stipend. They are of the sanest
and most human of our kind&mdash;laborers
daily for their meed of wage, knowing
the sweetness of bread well earned, of
work well done, and rest well won.</p>

<p>Even from the diseased view of a veritable
hater of their sex they have a vast
educational influence in the world at
large, whether their work is “authoritative”
or “unauthoritative,” according
to pronunciamento of some one who assumes
authority to call them “unauthoritative.”
It must not be forgotten&mdash;to
repeat for clearness’ sake&mdash;that men
laboring in these very duties met and
disputed every step the women took
even in “unauthoritative” work, using
ridicule, caste distinction, and all the
means of intimidation which a power
long dominant naturally possesses. To
work for lower wages alone allowed the
women to gain employment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>“You harshly blame my strengthlessness
and the woman-delicacy of my
body,” exclaims the Antigone of Euripides,
according to another citation of the
“Florilegium,” of Stobæus named at
the beginning, “but if I am of understanding
mind&mdash;that is better than a
strong arm.”</p>

<p>Defendants whose case would otherwise
go by default need this brief plea,
which their own modesty forbids their
uttering, their modesty, their busy hands
and heads, and their Antigone-like love
and ἀσθένεια. They know sympathy is
really as large as the world, and that
room is here for other women than
those who make dictionaries at so much
a mile as well as for themselves; and
for other men than neurotic caterwaulers
and hysterical shriekers like our ancient
friend Knox, assuming that the
masculine is the only form of expression,
that women have no right to utter
the human voice, and that certain men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
have up wire connections with omniscient
knowledge and Nature’s designs
and God’s will, and, standing
on this pretence, are the dispensers of
authority.</p>

<p>“If the greatest poems have not been
written by women,” said our Edgar Poe,
with a clearer accent of the American
spirit toward women, “it is because, as
yet, the greatest poems have not been
written at all.” The measure is large
between the purple-faced zeal of John
Knox and the vivid atavism of our
brilliant professor and that luminous
vision of Poe.

<p>The cook-book is not a modern product.
The Iliad is the hungriest book on
earth, and it is the first of our cook-books
aside from half-sacred, half-sanitary
directions to the early Aryans and
Jews. It is that acme of poetry, that
most picturesque of pictures, that most
historical of histories, that most musical
and delicious verse, the Iliad, which was
the first popularly to teach the cooking
art&mdash;the art in its simplicity, and not a
mere handmaid to sanitation, jurisprudence,
or theology. Through the pages
of that great poem blow not only the
salt winds of the Ægean Sea, but also
the savor of tender kid and succulent
pig, not to mention whole hectacombs,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
which delighted the blessed gods above
and strengthened hungry heroes below.
To this very day&mdash;its realism is so perfect&mdash;we
catch the scent of the cooking
and see the appetiteful people eat. The
book is half-human, half-divine; and in
its human part the pleasures and the
economic values of wholesome fare are
not left out.</p>

<p>No, cook-books are not modern products.
They were in Greece later than
Homer. When the Greek states came to
the fore in their wonderful art and literature
and the distinction of a free
democracy, plain living characterized
nearly all the peoples. The Athenians
were noted for their simple diet. The
Spartans were temperate to a proverb,
and their συσσίτια (public meals), later
called φειδίτια (spare meals), guarded
against indulgence in eating. To be a
good cook was to be banished from
Sparta.</p>

<p>But with the Western Greeks, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
Greeks of Sicily and Southern Italy, it
was different&mdash;those people who left
behind them little record of the spirit.
In Sybaris the cook who distinguished
himself in preparing a public feast&mdash;such
festivals being not uncommon&mdash;received
a crown of gold and the freedom
of the games. It was a citizen of that
luxury-loving town who averred, when
he tasted the famous black soup, that it
was no longer a wonder the Spartans
were fearless in battle, for any one
would readily die rather than live on
such a diet. Among the later Greeks the
best cooks, and the best-paid cooks, came
from Sicily; and that little island grew
in fame for its gluttons.</p>

<p>There is a Greek book&mdash;the Deipnosophistæ&mdash;Supper
of the “Wise Men&mdash;written
by Athenæus&mdash;which holds for
us much information about the food and
feasting of those old Hellenes. The wise
men at their supposed banquet quote,
touching food and cooking, from countless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
Greek authors whose works are now
lost, but were still preserved in the time
of Athenæus. This, for instance, is from
a poem by Philoxenus of Cythera, who
wittily and gluttonously lived at the
court of Dionysius of Syracuse, and
wished for a throat three cubits long
that the delight of tasting might be
drawn out.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<span class="i0">“And then two slaves brought in a well-rubb’d table.<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>The Greeks used many of the meats
and vegetables we enjoy; and others we
disclaim; for instance, cranes. Even
mushrooms were known to their cooks,
and Athenæus suggests how the wholesome
may be distinguished from the
poisonous, and what antidotes serve best
in case the bad are eaten. But with
further directions of his our tastes
would not agree. He recommends seasoning
the mushrooms with vinegar, or
honey and vinegar, or honey, or salt&mdash;for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
by these means their choking
properties are taken away.</p>

<p>The writings of Athenæus have, however,
a certain literary and, for his time
as well as our own, an historic and archæologic
flavor. The only ancient cook-book
pure and simple&mdash;bent on instruction
in the excellent art&mdash;which has come
down to us is that of Apicius, in ten
short books, or chapters. And which
Apicius? Probably the second of the
name, the one who lectured on cooking
in Rome during the reign of Augustus.
He gave some very simple directions
which hold good to the present day; for
instance&mdash;</p>

<p><small>“UT CARNEM SALSAM DULCEM FACIAS</small></p>

<p>“Carnem salsam dulcem facies, si
prius in lacte coquas, et postea in aqua.”</p>

<p>But again his compounds are nauseating
even in print. He was famous
for many dishes, and Pliny, in his Natural
History, says he discovered the way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
of increasing the size of the liver of the
pig&mdash;just as the liver of the Strasbourg
geese is enlarged for pâté de foie gras,
and as our own Southern people used
to induce pathological conditions in their
turkeys.</p>

<p>The method of Apicius was to cram
the pig with dried figs, and, when it was
fat enough, drench it with wine mixed
with honey. “There is,” continues
Pliny, “no other animal that affords so
great a variety to the palate; all others
have their taste, but the pig fifty different
flavors. From this tastiness of the
meat it came about that the censors
made whole pages of regulations about
serving at banquets the belly and the
jowls and other dainty parts. But in
spite of their rules the poet Publius,
author of the Mimes, when he ceased to
be a slave, is said never to have given
an entertainment without a dish of pig’s
belly which he called ‘sumen.’”</p>

<p>“Cook Apicius showed a remarkable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
ingenuity in developing luxury,” the
old Roman says at another time, “and
thought it a most excellent plan to let
a mullet die in the pickle known as
‘garum.’” It was ingenuity of cruelty
as well as of luxury. “They killed the
fish in sauces and pickled them alive at
the banquet,” says Seneca, “feeding the
eye before the gullet, for they took pleasure
in seeing their mullets change several
colors while dying.” The unthinkable
garum was made, according to
Pliny, from the intestines of fish macerated
with salt, and other ingredients
were added before the mixture was set
in the sun to putrefy and came to the
right point for serving. It also had
popularity as a household remedy for
dog-bites, etc.; and in burns, when care
was necessary in its application not to
mention it by name&mdash;so delicately timid
was its healing spirit. Its use as a dish
was widespread, and perhaps we see in
the well-known hankerings of the royal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
George of England a reversion to the
palate of Italian ancestors.</p>

<p>But garum was only one of strange
dishes. The Romans seasoned much
with rue and asafetida!&mdash;a taste kept to
this day in India, where “Kim” eats
“good curry cakes all warm and well-scented
with hing (asafetida).” Cabbages
they highly estimated; “of all
garden vegetables they thought them
best,” says Pliny. The same author
notes that Apicius rejected Brussels
sprouts, and in this was followed by
Drusus Cæsar, who was censured for
over-nicety by his father, the Emperor
Tiberius of Capreæ villas fame.</p>

<p>Upon cooks and the Roman estimate
of their value in his day Pliny also casts
light. “Asinius Celer, a man of consular
rank and noted for his expenditure
on mullet, bought one at Rome during
the reign of Gaius Caligula for eight
thousand sesterces. Reflection on this
fact,” continues Pliny, “will recall the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
complaints uttered against luxury and
the lament that a single cook costs more
than a horse. At the present day a cook
is only to be had for the price of a
triumph, and a mullet only to be had for
what was once the price of a cook! Of
a fact there is now hardly any living
being held in higher esteem than the man
who knows how to get rid of his master’s
belongings in the most scientific
fashion!”</p>

<p>Much has been written of the luxury
and enervation of Romans after the republic,
how they feasted scented with
perfumes, reclining and listening to
music, “nudis puellis ministrantibus.”
The story is old of how Vedius Pollio
“hung with ecstasy over lampreys fattened
on human flesh;” how Tiberius
spent two days and two nights in one
bout; how Claudius dissolved pearls for
his food; how Vitellius delighted in the
brains of pheasants and tongues of
nightingales and the roe of fish difficult
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
to take; how the favorite supper of
Heliogabalus was the brains of six hundred
thrushes. At the time these gluttonies
went on in the houses of government
officials, the mass of the people, the
great workers who supported the great
idlers, fed healthfully on a mess of pottage.
The many to support the super-abundant
luxury of a few is still one of
the mysteries of the people.</p>

<p>But in the old Rome the law of right
and honest strength at last prevailed,
and monsters gave way to the cleaner
and hardier chiefs of the north. The
mastery of the world necessarily passed
to others;&mdash;it has never lain with slaves
of the stomach.</p>

<p>The early folk of Britain&mdash;those Cæesar
found in the land from which we
sprang&mdash;ate the milk and flesh of their
flocks. They made bread by picking the
grains from the ear and pounding them
to paste in a mortar. Their Roman conquerors
doubtless brought to their midst
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
a more elaborated table order. Barbarous
Saxons, fighters and freebooters,
next settling on the rich island and restraining
themselves little for sowing
and reaping, must in their incursions
have been flesh-eaters, expeditiously
roasting and broiling directly over coals
like our early pioneers.</p>

<p>This mode of living also would seem
true of the later-coming Danes, who
after their settlement introduced, says
Holinshed, another habit. “The Danes,”
says that delightful chronicler, “had
their dwelling ... among the Englishmen,
whereby came great harme; for
whereas the Danes by nature were great
drinkers, the Englishmen by continuall
conversation with them learned the same
vice. King Edgar, to reforme in part
such excessive quaffing as then began to
grow in use, caused by the procurement
of Dunstane [the then Archbishop of
Canterbury] nailes to be set in cups of
a certeine measure, marked for the purpose,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
that none should drinke more than
was assigned by such measured cups.
Englishmen also learned of the Saxons,
Flemings, and other strangers, their
peculiar kinds of vices, as of the Saxons
a disordered fierceness of mind,
of the Flemings a feeble tendernesse
of bodie; where before they rejoiced
in their owne simplicitie and esteemed
not the lewd and unprofitable manners
of strangers.”</p>

<p>But refinement was growing in the
mixture of races which was to make modern
Englishmen, and in the time of Hardicanute,
much given to the pleasures
of the table and at last dying from too
copious a draught of wine,&mdash;“he fell
downe suddenlie,” says Holinshed,
“with the pot in his hand”&mdash;there was
aim at niceness and variety and hospitable
cheer.</p>

<p>The Black Book of a royal household
which Warner quotes in his “Antiquitates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
Culinariæ”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> is evidence of
this:</p>

<p>“Domus Eegis Hardeknoute may be
called a fader noreshoure of familiaritie,
which used for his own table, never to
be served with ony like metes of one
meale in another, and that chaunge and
diversitie was dayly in greate habundance,
and that same after to be ministred
to his alms-dishe, he caused
cunyng cooks in curiositie; also, he was
the furst that began four meales stablyshed
in oon day, opynly to be holden
for worshuppfull and honest peopull resorting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
to his courte; and no more melis,
nor brekefast, nor chambyr, but for his
children in householde; for which four
melys he ordeyned four marshalls, to
kepe the honor of his halle in recevyng
and dyrecting strangers, as well as of
his householdemen in theyre fitting, and
for services and ther precepts to be
obeyd in. And for the halle, with all
diligence of officers thereto assigned
from his furst inception, tyll the day of
his dethe, his house stode after one unyformitie.”</p>

<p>Of Hardicanute, “it hath,” says
Holinshed, “beene commonlie told, that
Englishmen learned of him their excessive
gourmandizing and unmeasurable
filling of their panches with meates and
drinkes, whereby they forgat the vertuous
use of sobrietie, so much necessarie
to all estates and degrees, so profitable
for all commonwealthes, and so
commendable both in the sight of God,
and all good men.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

<p>Not only to the Danes, but also to the
later conquerors, the Normans, the old
chronicler attributes corruption of early
English frugality and simplicity. “The
Normans, misliking the gormandise of
Canutus, ordeined after their arrivall
that no table should be covered above
once in the day.... But in the end,
either waxing wearie of their owne frugalitie
or suffering the cockle of old
custome to overgrow the good corne of
their new constitution, they fell to such
libertie that in often feeding they surmounted
Canutus surnamed the hardie....
They brought in also the custome
of long and statelie sitting at meat.”</p>

<p>A fellow-Londoner with Holinshed,
John Stow, says of the reign of William
Rufus, the second Norman king of England,
“The courtiers devoured the substance
of the husbandmen, their tenants.”</p>

<p>And Stow’s “Annales” still further
tell of a banquet served in far-off Italy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
to the duke of Clarence, son of Edward
III., when, some three hundred years
after the Norman settlement, the lad
Leonell went to marry Violentis, daughter
of the duke of Milan. It should not
be forgotten that in the reign of Edward
II. of England, grandfather of the duke,
proclamation had been issued against
the “outrageous and excessive multitude
of meats and dishes” served by the
nobles in their castles, as well by “persons
of inferior rank imitating their example,
beyond what their station required
and their circumstances could
afford.”</p>

<p>“At the comming of Leonell”, says
Stow, “such aboundance of treasure
was in most bounteous maner spent, in
making most sumptuous feasts, setting
forth stately fightes, and honouring with
rare gifts above two hundred Englishmen,
which accompanied his [the duke
of Milan’s] son-in-law, as it seemed to
surpasse the greatnesse of most wealthy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
Princes; for in the banquet whereat
Francis Petrarch was present, amongst
the chiefest guestes, there were above
thirtie courses of service at the table,
and betwixt every course, as many presents
of wonderous price intermixed, all
which John Galeasius, chiefe of the
choice youth, bringing to the table, did
offer to Leonell ... And such was the
sumptuousnesse of that banquet, that
the meats which were brought from the
table, would sufficiently have served ten
thousand men.”</p>

<p>The first cook-book we have in our
ample English tongue is of date about
1390. Its forme, says the preface to the
table of contents, this “forme of cury
[cookery] was compiled of the chef
maistes cokes of kyng Richard the Secunde
kyng of nglond aftir the conquest;
the which was accounted the best and
ryallest vyand [nice eater] of alle csten
ynges [Christian kings]; and it was
compiled by assent and avysement of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
maisters and [of] phisik and of philosophie
that dwellid in his court. First it
techith a man for to make commune
pottages and commune meetis for howshold,
as they shold be made, craftly and
holsomly. Aftirward it techith for to
make curious potages, and meetes, and
sotiltees, for alle maner of states, bothe
hye and lowe. And the techyng of the
forme of making of potages, and of
meetes, bothe of flesh, and of fissh, buth
[are] y sette here by noumbre and by
ordre. Sso this little table here fewyng
[following] wole teche a man with oute
taryyng, to fynde what meete that hym
lust for to have.”</p>

<p>The “potages” and “meetis” and
“sotiltees” it techith a man for to make
would be hardly more endurable to the
modern stomach than some old Greek
and Roman seasonings we have referred
to. There is no essential difference
between these and the directions of a
rival cook-book written some forty or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
fifty years later and divided into three
parts&mdash;Kalendare de Potages dyvers,
Kalendare de Leche Metys, Dyverse bake
metis. Or of another compiled about
1450. Let us see how they would make
a meat.</p>

<p>“Stwed Beeff. Take faire Ribbes of
ffresh beef, And (if thou wilt) roste hit
til hit be nygh ynowe; then put hit in
a faire possenet; caste therto parcely
and oynons mynced, reysons of corauns,
powder peper, canel, clowes, saundres,
safferon, and salt; then caste thereto
wyn and a litull vynegre; sette a lyd
on the potte, and lete hit boile sokingly
on a faire charcole til hit be ynogh; then
lay the fflessh, in disshes, and the sirippe
thereuppon, And serve it forth.”</p>

<p>And for sweet apple fritters:</p>

<p>“Freetours. Take yolkes of egges,
drawe hem thorgh a streynour, caste
thereto faire floure, berme and ale;
stere it togidre till hit be thik. Take
pared appelles, cut hem thyn like obleies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
[wafers of the eucharist], ley hem in the
batur; then put hem into a ffrying pan,
and fry hem in faire grece or buttur til
thei ben browne yelowe; then put hem
in disshes; and strawe Sugur on hem
ynogh, And serve hem forthe.”</p>

<p>Still other cook-books followed&mdash;the
men of that day served hem forthe&mdash;among
which we notice “A noble Boke
off Cookry ffor a prynce houssolde or
eny other estately houssolde,” ascribed
to about the year 1465.</p>

<p>To the monasteries the art of cooking
is doubtless much indebted, just as even
at the present day is the art of making
liqueurs. Their vast wealth, the leisure
of the in-dwellers, and the gross sensualism
and materialism of the time they
were at their height would naturally lead
to care for the table and its viands.
Within their thick stone walls, which
the religious devotion of the populace
had reared, the master of the kitchen,
magister coquinæ or magnus coquus,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
was not the man of least importance.
Some old author whose name and book
do not come promptly to memory refers
to the disinclination of plump capons,
or round-breasted duck, to meet ecclesiastical
eyes&mdash;a facetiousness repeated
in our day when the Uncle Remuses
of Dixie say they see yellow-legged
chickens run and hide if a preacher
drives up to supper.</p>

<p>Moreover, the monasteries were the
inns of that day where travellers put
up, and in many instances were served
free&mdash;no price, that is, was put upon
their entertainment, the abbot, or the
establishment, receiving whatever gift
the one sheltered and fed felt able or
moved to pay.</p>

<p>Contemporary accounts of, or references
to, the cooking and feasting in
religious houses are many&mdash;those of the
Vision of Long Will concerning Piers
the Plowman, those of “Dan Chaucer,
the first warbler,” of Alexander Barclay,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
and Skelton, great satirist of times
of Henry VIII., and of other authors
not so well remembered. Now and then
a racy anecdote has come down like that
which Thomas Fuller saves from lip tradition
in his “History of Abbeys in
England.” It happened, says Worthy
Fuller, that Harry VIII., “hunting in
Windsor Forest, either casually lost, or
(more probable) wilfully losing himself,
struck down about dinner-time to the
abbey of Reading; where, disguising
himself (much for delight, more for discovery,
to see unseen), he was invited
to the abbot’s table, and passed for one
of the king’s guard, a place to which the
proportion of his person might properly
entitle him. A sirloin of beef was set
before him (so knighted saith tradition,
by this King Henry), on which the king
laid on lustily, not disgracing one of that
place for whom he was mistaken.</p>

<p>“‘Well fare thy heart!’ quoth the
abbot; ‘and here in a cup of sack I remember
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
the health of his grace your
master. I would give an hundred
pounds on the condition I could feed so
heartily on beef as you do. Alas! my
weak and squeazy stomach will badly
digest the wing of a small rabbit or
chicken.’</p>

<p>“The king pleasantly pledged him,
and, heartily thanking him for his good
cheer, after dinner departed as undiscovered
as he came thither.</p>

<p>“Some weeks after, the abbot was sent
for by a pursuivant, brought up to London,
clapped in the Tower, kept close
prisoner, fed for a short time with bread
and water; yet not so empty his body of
food, as his mind was filled with fears,
creating many suspicions to himself
when and how he had incurred the
king’s displeasure. At last a sirloin of
beef was set before him, on which the
abbot fed as the farmer of his grange,
and verified the proverb, that ‘Two
hungry meals make the third a glutton.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>“In springs King Henry out of a private
lobby, where he had placed himself,
the invisible spectator of the abbot’s
behavior. ‘My lord,’ quoth the king,
‘presently deposit your hundred pounds
in gold, or else no going hence all the
days of your life. I have been your
physician to cure you of your squeazy
stomach; and here, as I deserve, I demand
my fee for the same!’</p>

<p>“The abbot down with his dust; and,
glad he had escaped so, returned to
Reading, as somewhat lighter in purse,
so much more merrier in heart than
when he came thence.”</p>

<p>The “squeazy” abbot stood alone in
proclamation of his disorder. Archbishop
Cranmer, according to John
Leland, king’s antiquary to Henry
VIII., found it necessary in 1541 to regulate
the expenses of the tables of bishops
and clergy by a constitution&mdash;an instrument
which throws much light on the
then conditions, and which ran as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p>“In the yeare of our Lord MDXLI
it was agreed and condescended upon,
as wel by the common consent of both
tharchbishops and most part of the
bishops within this realme of Englande,
as also of divers grave men at that tyme,
both deanes and archdeacons, the fare
at their tables to be thus moderated.</p>

<p>“First, that tharchbishop should
never exceede six divers kindes of fleshe,
or six of fishe, on the fishe days; the
bishop not to exceede five, the deane and
archdeacon not above four, and al other
under that degree not above three; provided
also that tharchbishop myght have
of second dishes four, the bishop three,
and al others under the degree of a
bishop but two. As custard, tart, fritter,
cheese or apples, peares, or two of other
kindes of fruites. Provided also, that if
any of the inferior degree dyd receave
at their table, any archbishop, bishop,
deane, or archdeacon, or any of the
laitie of lyke degree, viz. duke, marques,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
earle, viscount, baron, lorde, knyght,
they myght have such provision as were
mete and requisite for their degrees.
Provided alway that no rate was limited
in the receavying of any ambassadour.
It was also provided that of the greater
fyshes or fowles, there should be but one
in a dishe, as crane, swan, turkey cocke,
hadocke, pyke, tench; and of lesse sortes
but two, viz. capons two, pheasantes
two, conies two, and woodcockes two.
Of lesse sortes, as of patriches, the archbishop
three, the bishop and other degrees
under hym two. Of blackburdes,
the archbishop six, the bishop four, the
other degrees three. Of larkes and
snytes (snipes) and of that sort but
twelve. It was also provided, that whatsoever
is spared by the cutting of, of the
olde superfluitie, shoulde yet be provided
and spent in playne meates for the
relievyng of the poore. <i>Memorandum</i>,
that this order was kept for two or three
monethes, tyll by the disusyng of certaine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
wylful persons it came to the olde
excesse.”</p>

<p>Still one more tale bearing upon a
member of the clergy who would set out
more “blackburdes” than “tharchbishop”
is told by Holinshed. It has
within it somewhat of the flavor of the
odium theologicum, but an added interest
also, since it turns upon a dish esteemed
in Italy since the time of the imperial
Romans&mdash;peacock, often served even
nowadays encased in its most wonderful
plumage. The Pope Julius III., whose
luxurious entertainment and comport
shocked the proprieties even of that day,
and who died in Rome while the chronicler
was busy in London, is the chief
actor.</p>

<p>“At an other time,” writes Holinshed,
“he sitting at dinner, pointing to a peacocke
upon his table, which he had not
touched; Keepe (said he) this cold peacocke
for me against supper, and let me
sup in the garden, for I shall have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
ghests. So when supper came, and
amongst other hot peacockes, he saw not
his cold peacocke brought to his table;
the pope after his wonted manner, most
horriblie blaspheming God, fell into an
extreame rage, &amp;c. Whereupon one of
his cardinals sitting by, desired him
saieng: Let not your holinesse, I praie
you, be so mooved with a matter of so
small weight. Then this Julius the pope
answeringe againe: What (saith he) if
God was so angrie for one apple, that he
cast our first parents out of paradise
for the same, whie maie not I being his
vicar, be angrie then for a peacocke,
sithens a peacocke is a greater matter
than an apple.”</p>

<p>In England at this time controlling
the laity were sumptuary laws, habits of
living resulting from those laws, and
great inequalities in the distribution of
wealth. On these points Holinshed
again brings us light:</p>

<p>“In number of dishes and change of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
meat,” he writes, “the nobilitie of England
(whose cookes are for the most
part musicall-headed Frenchmen and
strangers) do most exceed, sith there is
no daie in maner that passeth over their
heads, wherein they have not onelie
beefe, mutton, veale, lambe, kid, porke,
conie, capon, pig, or so manie of these
as the season yeeldeth; but also some
portion of the red or fallow deere, beside
great varietie of fish and wild foule,
and thereto sundrie other delicates
wherein the sweet hand of the seasoning
Portingale is not wanting; so that for a
man to dine with one of them, and to
taste of everie dish that standeth before
him ... is rather to yeeld unto a conspiracie
with a great deale of meat for
the speedie suppression of naturall
health, then the use of a necessarie
meane to satisfie himselfe with a competent
repast, to susteine his bodie withall.
But as this large feeding is not seene
in their gests, no more is it in their owne
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
persons, for sith they have dailie much
resort unto their tables ... and thereto
reteine great numbers of servants, it is
verie requisit and expedient for them to
be somewhat plentifull in this behalfe.</p>

<p>“The chiefe part likewise of their
dailie provision is brought before them
... and placed on their tables, whereof
when they have taken what it pleaseth
them, the rest is reserved and afterwards
sent downe to their serving men
and waiters, who feed thereon in like
sort with convenient moderation, their
reversion also being bestowed upon the
poore, which lie readie at their gates in
great numbers to receive the same.</p>

<p>“The gentlemen and merchants keepe
much about one rate, and each of them
contenteth himselfe with foure, five or
six dishes, when they have but small resort,
or peradventure with one, or two,
or three at the most, when they have no
strangers to accompanie them at their
tables. And yet their servants have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
their ordinarie diet assigned, beside
such as is left at their masters’ boordes,
and not appointed to be brought thither
the second time, which neverthelesse is
often seene generallie in venison, lambe,
or some especiall dish, whereon the merchant
man himselfe liketh to feed when
it is cold.”</p>

<p>“At such times as the merchants doo
make their ordinarie or voluntarie
feasts, it is a world to see what great
provision is made of all maner of delicat
meats, from everie quarter of the
countrie.... They will seldome regard
anie thing that the butcher usuallie killeth,
but reject the same as not worthie
to come in place. In such cases all
gelisses of all coleurs mixed with a
varitie in the representation of sundrie
floures, herbs, trees, formes of beasts,
fish, foules and fruits, and there unto
marchpaine wrought with no small curiositie,
tarts of diverse hewes and sundrie
denominations, conserves of old fruits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
foren and homebred, suckets, codinacs,
marmilats, marchpaine, sugerbread, gingerbread,
florentines, wild foule, venison
of all sorts, and sundrie outlandish confections
altogither seasoned with sugar
... doo generalie beare the swaie, beside
infinit devises of our owne not possible
for me to remember. Of the potato and
such venerous roots as are brought out
of Spaine, Portingale, and the Indies to
furnish our bankets, I speake not.”</p>

<p>“The artificer and husbandman make
greatest accompt of such meat as they
may soonest come by, and have it quickliest
readie.... Their food also consisteth
principallie in beefe and such
meat as the butcher selleth, that is to
saie, mutton, veale, lambe, porke, etc.,
... beside souse, brawne, bacon, fruit,
pies of fruit, foules of sundrie sorts,
cheese, butter, eggs, etc.... To conclude,
both the artificer and the husbandman
are sufficientlie liberall and
verie friendlie at their tables, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
when they meet they are so merie
without malice and plaine, without inward
Italian or French craft and subtiltie,
that it would doo a man good to
be in companie among them.</p>

<p>“With us the nobilitie, gentrie and
students doo ordinarilie go to dinner at
eleven before noone, and to supper at
five, or betweene five and six at after-noone.
The merchants dine and sup seldome
before twelve at noone, and six at
night, especiallie in London. The husbandmen
dine also at high noone as they
call it, and sup at seven or eight....
As for the poorest sort they generallie
dine and sup when they may, so that to
talke of their order of repast it were but
a needlesse matter.”</p>

<p>“The bread through out the land,”
continues Holinshed, “is made of such
graine as the soil yeeldeth, neverthelesse
the gentilitie commonlie provide themselves
sufficientlie of wheat for their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
owne tables, whilst their houshold and
poore neighbours in some shires are inforced
to content themselves with rie, or
baricie, yea and in time of dearth manie
with bread made either of beans, or peason,
or otes, or of altogether and some
acornes among.... There be much
more ground eared now almost in everie
place than hath beene of late yeares, yet
such a price of come continueth in each
towne and market without any just
cause (except it be that landlords doo
get licenses to carie come out of the land
onelie to keepe up the prices for their
owne private games and ruine of the
commonwealth), that the artificer and
poore laboring man is not able to reach
unto it, but is driven to content himselfe
with horsse corne&mdash;I mean beanes, peason,
otes, tarres, and lintels.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Books had been written for women
and their tasks within&mdash;the “Babees
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
Booke,” Tusser’s<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> “Hundrethe Good
Pointes of Huswifry,” “The Good
Husive’s Handmaid”&mdash;the last two in
the sixteenth century; these and others
of their kidney. A woman who thought,
spoke, and wrote in several tongues was
greatly filling the throne of England in
those later times.</p>

<p>Cook- and receipt-books in the following
century, that is in the seventeenth,
continued to discover women, and to
realize moreover that to them division
of labor had delegated the household and
its businesses. There were “Jewels”
and “Closets of Delights” before we
find an odd little volume putting out in
1655 a second edition. It shows upon
its title-page the survival from earlier
conditions of the confusion of duties of
physician and cook&mdash;a fact made apparent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
in the preface copied in the foregoing
“forme of cury” of King Richard&mdash;and
perhaps intimates the housewife
should perform the services of both. It
makes, as well, a distinct appeal to
women as readers and users of books.
Again it evidences the growth of the
Commons. In full it introduces itself in
this wise:</p>

<p>“The Ladies Cabinet enlarged and
opened: containing Many Rare Secrets
and Rich Ornaments, of several kindes,
and different uses. Comprized under
three general Heads, viz. of 1 Preserving,
Conserving, Candying, etc. 2
Physick and Chirurgery. 3 Cooking
and Housewifery. Whereunto is added
Sundry Experiments and choice Extractions
of Waters, Oyls, etc. Collected
and practised by the late Right Honorable
and Learned Chymist, the Lord
Ruthuen.”</p>

<p>The preface, after an inscription “To
the Industrious improvers of Nature by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
Art; especially the vertuous Ladies and
Gentlewomen of the Land,” begins:</p>

<p>“Courteous Ladies, etc. The first
Edition of this&mdash;(cal it what you please)
having received a kind entertainment
from your Ladiships hands, for reasons
best known to yourselves, notwithstanding
the disorderly and confused jumbling
together of things of different
kinds, hath made me (who am not a little
concerned therein) to bethink myself of
some way, how to encourage and requite
your Ladiships Pains and Patience (vertues,
indeed, of absolute necessity in
such brave employments; there being
nothing excellent that is not withal difficult)
in the profitable spending of your
vacant minutes.” This labored and
high-flying mode of address continues to
the preface’s end.... “I shall thus
leave you at liberty as Lovers in Gardens,
to follow your own fancies. Take
what you like, and delight in your
choice, and leave what you list to him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
whose labour is not lost if anything
please.”</p>

<p>In turning the leaves of the book
one comes upon such naïve discourse
as this:</p>

<p>“To make the face white and fair.</p>

<p>“Wash thy face with Rosemary boiled
in white wine, and thou shalt be fair;
then take Erigan and stamp it, and take
the juyce thereof, and put it all together
and wash thy face therewith. Proved.”</p>

<p>It was undoubtedly the success of
“The Ladies Cabinet” and its cousins
german that led to the publication of a
fourth edition in 1658 of another compilation,
which, according to the preface,
was to go “like the good Samaritane
giving comfort to all it met.” The title
was “The Queens Closet opened: Incomparable
Secrets in Physick, Chyrurgery,
Preserving, Candying, and
Cookery, As they were presented unto
the Queen By the most Experienced
Persons of our times....  Transcribed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
from the true Copies of her
Majesties own Receipt Books, by W. M.
one of her late Servants.” It is curious
to recall that this book was published
during the Cromwell Protectorate&mdash;1658
is the year of the death of Oliver&mdash;and
that the queen alluded to in the title&mdash;whose
portrait, engraved by the elder
William Faithorne, forms the frontispiece&mdash;was
Henrietta Maria, widow of
Charles I., and at that time an exile in
France.</p>

<p>During this century, which saw such
publications as Rose’s “School for the
Officers of the Mouth,” and “Nature Unembowelled,”
a woman, Hannah Wolley,
appears as author of “The Cook’s
Guide.” All such compilations have
enduring human value, but we actually
gain quite as much of this oldest of arts
from such records as those the indefatigable
Pepys left in his Diary. At that
time men of our race did not disdain a
knowledge of cookery. Izaak Walton,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
“an excellent angler, and now with
God,” dresses chub and trout in his
meadow-sweet pages. Even Thomas
Fuller, amid his solacing and delightful
“Worthies,” thinks of the housewife,
and gives a receipt for metheglin.</p>

<p>And a hundred years later Dr. Johnson’s
friend, the Rev. Richard Warner,
in his “Personal Recollections,” did not
hesitate to expand upon what he thought
the origin of mince pies. Warner’s
Johnsonian weight in telling his fantasy
recalls Goldsmith’s quip about the Doctor’s
little fish talking like whales, and
also Johnson’s criticism upon his own
“too big words and too many of them.”</p>

<p>Warner wrote, “In the early ages of
our country, when its present widely
spread internal trade and retail business
were yet in their infancy, and none of
the modern facilities were afforded to
the cook to supply herself ‘on the spur
of the moment,’ ... it was the practice
of all prudent housewives, to lay in, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
the conclusion of every year (from some
contiguous periodical fair), a stock sufficient
for the ensuing annual consumption,
of ... every sweet composition for
the table&mdash;such as raisins, currants, citrons,
and ‘spices of the best.’</p>

<p>“The ample cupboard ... within the
wainscot of the dining parlour itself
... formed the safe depository of these
precious stores.</p>

<p>“‘When merry Christmas-tide came
round’ ... the goodly litter of the cupboard,
thus various in kind and aspect,
was carefully swept into one common
receptacle; the mingled mass enveloped
in pastry and enclosed within the duly
heated oven, from whence ... perfect
in form, colour, odour, flavour and temperament,
it smoked, the glory of the
hospitable Christmas board, hailed from
every quarter by the honourable and imperishable
denomination of the Mince-Pye.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<p>In the eighteenth century women
themselves, following Hannah Wolley,
began cook-book compiling. So great
was their success that we find Mrs. Elizabeth
Moxon’s “English Housewifry”
going into its ninth edition in the London
market of 1764. All through history
there have been surprises coming to
prejudiced minds out of the despised
and Nazarene. It was so about this matter
of cook-books&mdash;small in itself, great
in its far-reaching results to the health
and development of the human race.</p>

<p>Women had been taught the alphabet.
But the dogmatism of Dr. Johnson
voiced the judgment of many of our
forebears: a dominant power is always
hard in its estimate of the capacities it
controls. “Women can spin very well,”
said the great Cham, “but they can not
make a good book of cookery.” He was
talking to “the swan of Lichfield,” little
Anna Seward, when he said this, and
also to a London publisher. The book
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
they were speaking of had been put
forth by the now famous Mrs. Hannah
Glasse, said to be the wife of a London
attorney.</p>

<p>The doctor&mdash;possibly with an eye to
business, a publisher being present&mdash;was
describing a volume he had in mind
to make, “a book upon philosophical
principles,” “a better book of cookery
than has ever yet been written.”
“Then,” wisely said the dogmatic doctor,
“as you can not make bad meat
good, I would tell what is the best
butcher’s meat, the best beef, the best
pieces; how to choose young fowls; the
proper seasons of different vegetables;
and then how to roast and boil and compound.”
This was the plan of a poet,
essayist, lexicographer, and the leading
man of letters of his day. His cook-book
was never written.</p>

<p>But good Mrs. Glasse had also with
large spirit aimed at teaching the ignorant,
possibly those of a kind least often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
thought of by instructors in her art.
She had, forsooth, caught her hare outside
her book, even if she never found
him in its page. “If I have not wrote in
the high polite style,” she says, with a
heart helpful toward the misunderstood
and oppressed, and possibly with the
pages of some pretentious chef in mind,
“I hope I shall be forgiven; for my intention
is to instruct the lower sort, and
therefore must treat them in their own
way. For example, when I bid them
lard a fowl, if I should bid them lard
with large lardoons, they would not
know what I meant; but when I say they
must lard with little pieces of bacon,
they know what I mean. So in many
other things in Cookery the great cooks
have such a high way of expressing
themselves, that the poor girls are at a
loss to know what they mean.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Glasse’s book was published in
1747&mdash;while Dr. Johnson had still thirty-seven
years in which to “boast of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
niceness of his palate,” and spill his
food upon his waistcoat. “Whenever,”
says Macaulay, “he was so fortunate as
to have near him a hare that had been
kept too long, or a meat pie made with
rancid butter, he gorged himself with
such violence that his veins swelled and
the moisture broke out on his forehead.”
But within forty-eight years of the December
his poor body was borne from
the house behind Fleet Street to its resting-place
in Westminster Abbey, a thin
volume, “The Frugal Housewife,”
written by our American Lydia Maria
Child, had passed to its ninth London
edition, in that day sales being more
often than in our own a testimony of
merit. This prevailing of justice over
prejudice is “too good for any but very
honest people,” as Izaak Walton said
of roast pike. Dogmatism is always
eating its own words.</p>

<p>Since the master in literature, Dr.
Johnson, planned his cook-book many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
cooking men have dipped ink in behalf
of instruction in their art. Such names
as Farley, Carême, and Soyer have been
written, if not in marble or bronze, at
least in sugar of the last caramel degree&mdash;unappreciated
excellencies mainly because
of the inattention of the public to
what nourishes it, and lack of the knowledge
that the one who introduces an
inexpensive, palatable, and digestible
dish benefits his fellow-men.</p>

<p>The names of these club cooks and
royal cooks are not so often referred to
as that of the large and human-hearted
Mrs. Glasse. A key to their impulse
toward book-making must, however,
have been that offered by Master Farley,
chief cook at the London Tavern,
who wrote in 1791, a hundred and fourteen
years ago: “Cookery, like every
other Art, has been moving forward to
perfection by slow Degrees.... And
although there are so many Books of
this Kind already published, that one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
would hardly think there could be Occasion
for another, yet we flatter ourselves,
that the Readers of this Work will find,
from a candid Perusal, and an impartial
Comparison, that our Pretensions to
the Favour of the Public are not ill-founded.”</p>

<p>Such considerations as those of Master
Farley seem to lead to the present
great output. But nowadays our social
conditions and our intricate and involved
household arrangements demand
a specialization of duties. The average
old cook-book has become insufficient.
It has evolved into household-directing
as well as cook-directing books, comprehending
the whole subject of esoteric
economies. This is a curious enlargement;
and one cause, and result, of it is
that the men and women of our domestic
corps are better trained, better equipped
with a logical, systematized, scientific
knowledge, that they are in a degree
specialists&mdash;in a measure as the engineer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
of an ocean greyhound is a specialist, or
the professor of mathematics, or the
writer of novels is a specialist. And
specialists should have the dignity of
special treatment. In this movement, it
is to be hoped, is the wiping out of the
social stigma under which domestic
service has so long lain in our country,
and a beginning of the independence of
the domestic laborer&mdash;that he or she
shall possess himself or herself equally
with others&mdash;as other free-born people
possess themselves, that is.</p>

<p>And closely allied with this specialization
another notable thing has come
about. Science with its microscope has
finally taught what religion with its
manifold precepts of humility and
humanity has failed for centuries to
accomplish, thus evidencing that true
science and true religion reach one and
the same end. There are no menial
duties, science clearly enunciates: the
so-called drudgery is often the most important
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
of work, especially when the
worker brings to his task a large knowledge
of its worth in preserving and
sweetening human life, and perfectness
as the sole and satisfactory aim. Only
the careless, thriftless workers, the inefficient
and possessed with no zeal for
perfection of execution, only these are
the menials according to the genuine
teachings of our day&mdash;and the ignorant,
unlifted worker’s work is menial (using
the word again in its modern English
and not its old Norman-French usage)
whatever his employment.</p>

<p>In verse this was said long ago, as the
imagination is always forestalling practical
knowledge, and George Herbert, of
the seventeenth century, foreran our
science in his “Elixir:”</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“All may of thee partake:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nothing can be so mean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which with this tincture <i>for thy sake</i><br /></span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Present-day, up-to-date books on
housekeeping stand for the fact that in
our households, whatever the estimates
of the past and of other social conditions,
all work is dignified&mdash;none is
menial. For besides intelligent knowledge
and execution, what in reality, they
ask, gives dignity to labor? Weight and
importance of that particular task to
our fellow-beings? What then shall we
say of the duties of cook? of housemaid?
of chambermaid? of the handy
man, or of the modest maid of all work?
For upon the efficient performance of
the supposedly humblest domestic servitor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
depends each life of the family.
Such interdependence brings the employed
very close to the employer, and
no bond could knit the varied elements
of a household more closely, none should
knit it more humanly.</p>

<p>The human, then, are the first of the
relations that exist between employer
and employee, that “God hath made of
one blood all nations of the earth.” It
is a truth not often enough in the minds
of the parties to a domestic-service compact.
And besides this gospel of Paul
are two catch-phrases, not so illuminated
but equally humane, which sprang from
the ameliorating spirit of the last century&mdash;“Put
yourself in his place,” and
“Everybody is as good as I.” These
form the best bed-rock for all relations
between master and servant. There is
need of emphasizing this point in our
books on affairs of the house, for a
majority of our notably rich are new to
riches and new to knowledge, and as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
employers have not learned the limitation
of every child of indulgence and
also polite manners in early life.</p>

<p>It is after all a difference of environment
that makes the difference between
mistress and maid, between master and
man. The human being is as plastic as
clay&mdash;is clay in the hands of circumstance.
If his support of wife and children
depended upon obsequiousness of
bearing, the master might, like the
butler, approximate Uriah Heep. If the
mistress’s love of delicacy and color had
not been cultivated by association with
taste from childhood, her finery might
be as vulgar as the maid’s which provokes
her satire. It is after all a question
of surroundings and education.
And in this country, where Aladdin-fortunes
spring into being by the rubbing
of a lamp&mdash;where families of, for
example, many centuries of the downtrodden
life of European peasant jump
from direst poverty to untold wealth&mdash;environment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
has often no opportunity to
form the folk of gentle breeding. Many
instances are not lacking where those
who wait are more gently bred than
those who are waited upon.</p>

<p>In their larger discourse, then, up-to-date
household books stand for the very
essence of democracy and human-heartedness&mdash;which
is also the very essence
of aristocracy. After the old manner
which Master Farley described, our
women seem to have given their books
to the public with the faith that they
contain much other books have not
touched&mdash;to stand for an absolutely
equable humanity, for kindness and
enduring courtesy between those who
employ and those who are employed, the
poor rich and the rich poor, the householders
and the houseworkers&mdash;to state
the relations between master and man
and mistress and maid more explicitly
than they have before been stated, and
thus to help toward a more perfect organization
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
of the forces that carry on
our households&mdash;to direct with scientific
and economic prevision the food of
the house members; to emphasize in all
departments of the house thoroughgoing
sanitation and scientific cleanliness.</p>

<p>Of questions of the household&mdash;of
housekeeping and home-making&mdash;our
American women have been supposed
somewhat careless. Possibly this judgment
over the sea has been builded upon
our women’s vivacity, and a subtle intellectual
force they possess, and also from
their interest in affairs at large, and
again from their careful and cleanly attention
to their person&mdash;“they keep their
teeth too clean,” says a much-read
French author. Noting such characteristics,
foreigners have jumped to the
conclusion that American women are not
skilled in works within doors. In almost
every European country this is common
report. “We German women are such
devoted housekeepers,” said the wife of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
an eminent Deutscher, “and you American
women know so little about such
things!” “Bless your heart!” I exclaimed&mdash;or
if not just that then its German
equivalent&mdash;thinking of the perfectly
kept homes from the rocks and
pines of Maine to the California surf;
“you German women with your little
haushaltungen, heating your rooms with
porcelain stoves, and your frequent reversion
in meals to the simplicity of
wurst and beer, have no conception of
the size and complexity of American
households and the executive capabilities
necessary to keep them in orderly
work. Yours is mere doll’s housekeeping&mdash;no
furnaces, no hot water, no electricity,
no elevators, no telephone, and
no elaborate menus.”</p>

<p>Our American women are model
housekeepers and home-makers, as thousands
of homes testify, but the interests
of the mistresses of these houses are
broader, their lives are commonly more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
projected into the outer world of organized
philanthropy and art than women’s
lives abroad, and the apparent non-intrusion
of domestic affairs leads foreigners
to misinterpret their interest
and their zeal. It is the consummate
executive who can set aside most personal
cares and take on others efficiently.
Moreover, it is not here as where a
learned professor declared: “Die erste
Tugend eines Weibes ist die Sparsamkeit.”</p>

<p>To have a home in which daily duties
move without noise and as like a clock
as its human machinery will permit, and
to have a table of simplicity and excellence,
is worth a pleasure-giving ambition
and a womanly ambition. It is to
bring, in current critical phrase, three-fourths
of the comfort of life to those
whose lives are joined to the mistress of
such a household&mdash;the loaf-giver who
spends her brains for each ordered day
and meal. Moreover, and greatest of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
all, to plan and carry on so excellent an
establishment is far-reaching upon all
men. It is the very essence of morality&mdash;is
duty&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, service&mdash;and law.</p>

<p>The French aver that men of the
larger capacity have for food a particularly
keen enjoyment. Possibly this
holds good for Frenchmen&mdash;for the
author of Monte Cristo, or for a Brillat-Savarin,
of whose taste the following
story is told: “Halting one day at Sens,
when on his way to Lyons, Savarin sent,
according to his invariable custom, for
the cook, and asked what he could have
for dinner. ‘Little enough,’ was the
reply. ‘But let us see,’ retorted Savarin;
‘let us go into the kitchen and talk
the matter over.’ There he found four
turkeys roasting. ‘Why!’ exclaimed he,
‘you told me you had nothing in the
house! let me have one of those turkeys.’
‘Impossible!’ said the cook;
‘they are all bespoken by a gentleman
up-stairs.’ ‘He must have a large party
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
to dine with him, then?’ ‘No; he dines
by himself.’ ‘Indeed!’ said the gastronome;
‘I should like much to be acquainted
with the man who orders four
turkeys for his own eating.’ The cook
was sure the gentleman would be glad
of his acquaintance, and Savarin, on
going to pay his respects to the stranger,
found him to be no other than his own
son. ‘What! you rascal! four turkeys
all to yourself!’ ‘Yes, sir,’ said Savarin,
junior; ‘you know that when we have a
turkey at home you always reserve for
yourself the pope’s nose; I was resolved
to regale myself for once in my life;
and here I am, ready to begin, although
I did not expect the honour of your
company.’”</p>

<p>The French may say truly of the
famous “high-priest of gastronomy.”
And a story which has lately appeared
in Germany tells of a sensitive palate in
Goethe: “At a small party at the court
of Weimar, the Marshal asked permission
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
to submit a nameless sample of
wine. Accordingly, a red wine was circulated,
tasted, and much commended.
Several of the company pronounced it
Burgundy, but could not agree as to the
special vintage or the year. Goethe
alone tasted and tasted again, shook his
head, and, with a meditative air, set his
glass on the table. ‘Your Excellency
appears to be of a different opinion,’
said the court marshal. ‘May I ask what
name you give to the wine?’ ‘The wine,’
said the poet, ‘is quite unknown to me;
but I do not think it is a Burgundy. I
should rather consider it a good Jena
wine that has been kept for some while
in a Madeira cask.’ ‘And so, in fact, it
is,’ said the court marshal. For a more
discriminating palate, one must go to the
story of the rival wine-tasters in ‘Don
Quixote,’ who from a single glass
detected the key and leather thong in a
cask of wine.”</p>

<p>But that great capacity means also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
discriminating palate could hardly be
true for Americans of the old stock and
simple life. Judge Usher, Secretary of
Interior in Lincoln’s Cabinet at the time
of the President’s death, said that he
had never heard Abraham Lincoln refer
to his food in any way whatever.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From a consideration of women’s
cook-books springs another suggestion.
Heaped upon one’s table, the open pages
and appetiteful illustrations put one to
thinking that if women of intelligence,
and of leisure except for burdens they
assume under so-called charity or a faddish
impulse, were to take each some
department of the household, and give
time and effort to gaining a complete
knowledge of that department&mdash;a knowledge
of its evolution and history, of its
scientific and hygienic bearings, of its
gastronomic values if it touched upon
the table&mdash;there would be great gain to
the world at large and to their friends.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
For instance, if a woman skilled in
domestic science and the domestic arts
were to take some fruit, or some vegetable,
or cereal, or meat, and develop
to the utmost what an old author-cook
calls, after those cook-oracles of ancient
Rome, the “Apician mysteries” of the
dish, her name would deserve to go down
to posterity with something of the odor&mdash;or
flavor&mdash;of sanctity. Hundreds of
saints in the calendar never did anything
half so meritorious and worthy of
felicitous recognition from their fellow-men.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the democratic
cabbage and its cousins german, and
their treatment in the average cuisine.
What might not such an investigation
show this Monsieur Chou or Herr Kohl
and his relations capable of!&mdash;the cabbage
itself, the Scotch kale, the Jersey
cabbage, and Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower,
and broccoli, and kohl-rabi, and
cabbage palms, and still other species!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
Looked at in their evolution, and the
part they have played in human history
as far back as in old Persia and the Anabasis
of the Greeks, and so late as the
famine times of Ireland, these succulent
and nutritious vegetables would be most
interesting. And, even if chemically
their elements vary, the fact that all the
family are blessed with a large percentage
of nitrogen might be shown to have
increased their usefulness long before
chemists analyzed their tissues and told
us why men who could not buy meat
so carefully cultivated the foody leaves.
Under such sane and beneficent impulses
every well-directed household would
become an experiment station for the
study of human food&mdash;not the extravagant
and rare after the test and search
of imperial Heliogabalus, but in the
best modern, scientific, economic, gastronomic,
and democratic manner.</p>

<p>Since making this foregoing suggestion
I find this point similarly touched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
by the man who dissertated on roast pig.
“It is a desideratum,” says Lamb, “in
works that treat de re culinaria, that we
have no rationale of sauces, or theory of
mixed flavours: as to show why cabbage
is reprehensible with roast beef, laudable
with bacon; why the haunch of mutton
seeks the alliance of currant jelly, the
shoulder civilly declineth it; why loin
of veal (a pretty problem), being itself
unctious, seeketh the adventitious lubricity
of melted butter&mdash;and why the
same part in pork, not more oleaginous,
abhorreth from it; why the French bean
sympathizes with the flesh of deer; why
salt fish points to parsnips.... We are
as yet but in the empirical stage of cookery.
We feed ignorantly, and want to
be able to give a reason of the relish
that is in us.”</p>

<p>In speaking of modern household
books one cannot have done without adding
still one word more about the use of
the word “servant” as these books seem
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
to speak of it. Owing to an attempted
Europeanizing of our ideas, and also to
the fact that many of our domestics are
of foreign birth and habits of thought&mdash;or
of the lowly, velvet-voiced, unassertive
suavity of the most loyal negro&mdash;the
term has gradually crept to a quasi acceptance
in this country. It is a word
not infrequently obnoxious to Americans&mdash;employers&mdash;of
the old stock, and
trained in the spirit which wrote the
Declaration of Independence and fought
its sequent War. “From the time of
the Revolution,” says Miss Salmon in
her “Domestic Service,” “until about
1850 the word ‘servant’ does not seem
to have been generally applied in either
section [north or south] to white persons
of American birth.”</p>

<p>The term indicates social conditions
which no longer exist and represents
ideas which no longer have real life&mdash;we
have but to consider how the radical
Defoe published, in 1724, “The Great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
Law of Subordination consider’d; or,
the Insolence and Unsufferable Behaviour
of Servants in England duly enquir’d
into,” to be convinced of our vast
advance in human sympathy&mdash;and a
revival of our American spirit toward
the word would be a wholesome course.
In the mouths of many who use it to
excess&mdash;those mainly at fault are innocently
imitative, unthinking, or pretentious
women&mdash;it sounds ungracious, if
not vulgar, and distinctly untrue to those
who made the country for us and desirable
for us to live in; and untrue also
to the best social feeling of to-day. It
is still for a genuine American rather
hard to imagine a person such as the
word “servant” connotes&mdash;a lackey, a
receiver of tips of any sort&mdash;with an
election ballot in hand and voting thinkingly,
knowingly, intelligently for the
guidance of our great government. It
would not have been so difficult for the
old δοῦλοι of Athens to vote upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
Pnyx as for such a man to vote aright
for us. And not infrequently, in the ups
and downs of speculation and the mushroom
growth and life of fortunes among
us, the “servant,” to use the old biblical
phrase, is sometimes greater in moral,
intellectual, and social graces than his
“lord.” The term belongs to times,
and the temperamental condition of
times when traces of slavery were
common, and when employers believed,
and acted upon the faith, that they
hired not a person’s labor but the
person himself&mdash;or herself&mdash;who was
subject to a sort of ownership and
control.</p>

<p>Let us remand the word to the days
of Dean Swift and such conditions as the
tremendous satire of his “Directions to
Servants” exhibited, in which&mdash;except
perhaps in Swift’s great heart&mdash;there
was neither the humanity of our times,
nor the courtesy of our times, nor the
sure knowledge of our times&mdash;which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
endeavor to create, and, in truth, are
gradually making trained and skilful
workers in every department, and demand
in return for service with perfectness
as its aim, independence of
the person, dignified treatment and
genuine respect from the employer.</p>

<p>All these things the women’s household
and cook-books will be, nay, are,
gradually teaching, and that which
Charles Carter, “lately cook to his
Grace the Duke of Argyle,” wrote in
1730 may still hold good: “’Twill be
very easy,” said Master Carter, “for
an ordinary Cook when he is well-instructed
in the most Elegant Parts of
his Profession to lower his Hand at any
time; and he that can excellently perform
in a Courtly and Grand Manner,
will never be at a Loss in any other.”
When this future knowledge and adjustment
come we shall be free from the tendencies
which Mistress Glasse, after her
outspoken manner, describes of her own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
generation: “So much is the blind folly
of this age,” cries the good woman,
“that they would rather be imposed
upon by a French booby than give encouragement
to a good English cook.”</p>

<p>Economic changes such as we have
indicated must in measurable time ensue.
The science and the art of conducting
a house are now obtaining recognition
in our schools. Not long, and
the knowledge will be widespread. Its
very existence, and the possibility of its
diffusion, is a result of the nineteenth
century movement for the broadening of
women’s knowledge and the expansion
of their interests and independence&mdash;this
wedded with the humane conviction
that the wisest and fruitfullest
use of scientific deduction and skill is
in the bettering of human life. Behind
and giving potence to these impulses is
the fellowship, liberty, and equality of
human kind&mdash;the great idea of democracy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>

<p>Already we have gone back to the
wholesomeness of our English forebears’
estimate that the physician and
cook are inseparable. Further still, we
may ultimately retrace our ideas, and
from the point of view of economics
and sociology declare that with us, as
with the old Jews and Greeks, the priest
and the cook are one.

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</h2>

<p>Among the jocularities of literature
none is greater than Squire Bickerstaff’s;
and none has had greater results&mdash;with
perhaps one exception. The
practicality of the Squire’s jest and the
flavor of it suited the century of Squire
Western rather than our own. But its
excuse was in the end it served of breaking
the old astrologer’s hold upon the
people.</p>

<p>Jonathan Swift is the writer to whom
the original Bickerstaff squibs are in
the main to be ascribed. It is due to
Swift’s clarity and strength that they
are among the best of literary fooling.</p>

<p>But Swift was not alone. He had
the help of Addison, Steele, Prior, Congreve,
and other wits of Will’s Coffee-House
and St. James’s. Together they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
set all London laughing. Upon Swift’s
shoulders, however, falls the onus of the
joke which must have been his recreation
amid pamphleteering and the smudging
of his ecclesiastical hand with political
ink. It happened in 1708.</p>

<p>The English almanac was not in
Swift’s day as in later times a simple
calendar of guesses about the weather.
It was rather a “prognosticator” in
ambiguous phrase of war, pestilence,
murder, and such horrors as our yellow
press nowadays serves up to readers,
like in development to the conning public
of the old almanacs. It was at all times
solemn and dogmatic. What the almanac
prognosticated was its philomath’s
duty to furnish. His science and pre-science
builded a supposed influence of
the stars and their movements upon the
moral life of man.</p>

<p>Squire Bicker staff’s jest had to do
with almanac-makers, and was directed
against a chief pretender, Dr. Partridge,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
the astrologer and philomath Pope refers
to when he speaks of the translation
of the raped “Lock” to the skies:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When next he looks through Galileo’s eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And hence th’ egregious wizard shall foredoom<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The fate of Louis and the fall of Rome.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the seventeenth century the ascendency
of these charlatans had become
alarming. One of the most adroit and
unscrupulous of their number&mdash;William
Lilly&mdash;had large following. They not
only had the popular ear, but now and
then a man like Dryden inclined to them.
Nor did Sir Thomas Browne “reject a
sober and regulated astrology.”</p>

<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth
century the scandal of their excesses was
growing, and it was then that Swift
came forward&mdash;just as Swift was constantly
coming forward with his great
humanity, in one instance to save Ireland
the infliction of Wood’s halfpence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
and again in protest against English restriction
of Irish trade; poor Swift’s
heart was always with the poor, the
duped and undefended&mdash;it was then that
Swift came forward with “Predictions
for the year 1708. Wherein the Month,
and the Day of the Month, are set down,
the Person named, and the great Actions
and Events of next Year particularly
related, as They will come to Pass.
Written to Prevent the People of England
from being farther imposed on by
the vulgar Almanack-Makers.”</p>

<p>The surname of the signature, “Isaac
Bickerstaff,” Swift took from a locksmith’s
sign. The Isaac he added as not
commonly in use.</p>

<p>“I have considered,” he begins, “the
gross abuse of astrology in this kingdom,
and upon debating the matter with myself,
I could not possibly lay the fault
upon the art, but upon those gross impostors,
who set up to be the artists. I
know several learned men have contended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
that the whole is a cheat; that
it is absurd and ridiculous to imagine
the stars can have any influence at all
upon human actions, thoughts, or inclinations;
and whoever has not bent his
studies that way may be excused for
thinking so, when he sees in how
wretched a manner that noble art is
treated by a few mean, illiterate traders
between us and the stars; who import a
yearly stock of nonsense, lies, folly, and
impertinence, which they offer to the
world as genuine from the planets,
though they descend from no greater a
height than their own brains....</p>

<p>“As for the few following predictions,
I now offer the world, I forebore to publish
them till I had perused the several
Almanacks for the year we are now
entered upon. I found them all in the
usual strain, and I beg the reader will
compare their manner with mine: and
here I make bold to tell the world that I
lay the whole credit of my art upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
truth of these predictions; and I will be
content that Partridge and the rest of
his clan may hoot me for a cheat and
impostor, if I fail in any single particular
of moment....</p>

<p>“My first prediction is but a trifle, yet
I will mention it to show how ignorant
these sottish pretenders to astrology are
in their own concerns: it relates to Partridge,
the Almanack-maker. I have
consulted the star of his nativity by my
own rules, and find he will infallibly die
upon the 29th of March next, about
eleven at night, of a raging fever; therefore
I advise him to consider of it, and
settle his affairs in time....”</p>

<p>An “Answer to Bickerstaff by a Person
of Quality,” evidently from the
hand of Swift and his friends, followed
these “Predictions.”</p>

<p>“I have not observed for some years
past,” it begins, “any insignificant
paper to have made more noise, or be
more greedily bought, than that of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
Predictions.... I shall not enter upon
the examination of them; but think it
very incumbent upon the learned Mr.
Partridge to take them into his consideration,
and lay as many errors in
astrology as possible to Mr. Bickerstaff’s
account. He may justly, I think,
challenge the ’squire to publish the calculation
he has made of Partridge’s
nativity, by the credit of which he so
determinately pronounces the time and
manner of his death; and Mr. Bickerstaff
can do no less in honour, than give
Mr. Partridge the same advantage of
calculating his, by sending him an
account of the time and place of his
birth, with other particulars necessary
for such a work. By which, no doubt,
the learned world will be engaged in the
dispute, and take part on each side
according as they are inclined....”</p>

<p>“The Accomplishment of the first of
Mr. Bickerstaff’s Predictions, being an
Account of the Death of Mr. Partridge,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
the Almanack-Maker, upon the 29th instant
in a Letter to a Person of Honour,
written in the year 1708,” continues the
jocularity.</p>

<p>“My Lord: In obedience to your
Lordship’s commands, as well as to satisfy
my own curiosity, I have some days
past inquired constantly after Partridge
the Almanack-maker, of whom it was
foretold in Mr. Bickerstaff’s Predictions,
published about a month ago, that
he should die the 29th instant, about
eleven at night, of a raging fever....
I saw him accidentally once or twice,
about ten days before he died, and
observed he began very much to droop
and languish, though I hear his friends
did not seem to apprehend him in any
danger. About two or three days ago he
grew ill, ... but when I saw him he
had his understanding as well as ever
I knew, and spoke strong and hearty,
without any seeming uneasiness or constraint
[saying].... ‘I am a poor ignorant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
fellow, bred to a mean trade, yet
I have sense enough to know that all
pretences of foretelling by astrology are
deceits for this manifest reason: because
the wise and the learned, who can only
judge whether there be any truth in this
science, do all unanimously agree to
laugh at and despise it; and none but
the poor, ignorant vulgar give it any
credit, and that only upon the word of
such silly wretches as I and my fellows,
who can hardly write or read.’...</p>

<p>“After half an hour’s conversation I
took my leave, being almost stifled with
the closeness of the room. I imagined
he could not hold out long, and therefore
withdrew to a little coffee-house hard by,
leaving a servant at the house with
orders to come immediately and tell me,
as near as he could, the minute when
Partridge should expire, which was not
above two hours after.”</p>

<p>The burlesque next before the public,
“Squire Bickerstaff detected; or, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
Astrological Impostor convicted, by
John Partridge, student of physic and
astrology, a True and Impartial account
of the Proceedings of Isaac Bickerstaff,
Esq., against me,” was doubtless drawn
up by Addison’s friend Yalden, whom
Scott speaks of as “Partridge’s near
neighbor.”</p>

<p>“The 28th of March, Anno Dom.
1708,” it begins, “being the night this
sham prophet had so impudently fixed
for my last, which made little impression
on myself: but I cannot answer for my
whole family; for my wife, with concern
more than usual, prevailed on me to take
somewhat to sweat for a cold; and
between the hours of eight and nine to
go to bed; the maid, as she was warming
my bed, with a curiosity natural to
young wenches, runs to the window, and
asks of one passing the street who the
bell tolled for? Dr. Partridge, says he,
the famous almanack-maker, who died
suddenly this evening: the poor girl,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
provoked, told him he lied like a rascal;
the other very sedately replied, the sexton
had so informed him, and if false,
he was to blame for imposing upon
a stranger. She asked a second, and a
third, as they passed, and every one was
in the same tone. Now, I do not say
these are accomplices to a certain astrological
’squire, and that one Bickerstaff
might be sauntering thereabout, because
I will assert nothing here, but what I
dare attest for plain matter of fact. My
wife at this fell into a violent disorder,
and I must own I was a little discomposed
at the oddness of the accident.
In the mean time one knocks at my door;
Betty runs down, and opening, finds a
sober grave person, who modestly inquires
if this was Dr. Partridge’s? She,
taking him for some cautious city
patient, that came at that time for privacy,
shews him into the dining-room.
As soon as I could compose myself, I
went to him, and was surprised to find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
my gentleman mounted on a table with
a two-foot rule in his hand, measuring
my walls, and taking the dimensions of
the room. Pray, sir, says I, not to interrupt
you, have you any business with
me?&mdash;Only, sir, replies he, order the girl
to bring me a better light, for this is a
very dim one.&mdash;Sir, says I, my name is
Partridge.&mdash;O! the doctor’s brother,
belike, cries he; the staircase, I believe,
and these two apartments hung in close
mourning will be sufficient, and only a
strip of bays round the other rooms.
The doctor must needs die rich, he had
great dealings in his way for many
years; if he had no family coat, you
had as good use the escutcheons of the
company, they are as showish, and will
look as magnificent, as if he was descended
from the blood royal.&mdash;With
that I assumed a greater air of authority,
and demanded who employed him,
or how he came there?&mdash;Why, I was sent,
sir, by the company of undertakers, says
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
he, and they were employed by the
honest gentleman, who is executor to the
good doctor departed; and our rascally
porter, I believe, is fallen fast asleep
with the black cloth and sconces, or he
had been here, and we might have been
tacking up by this time.&mdash;Sir, says I,
pray be advised by a friend, and make
the best of your speed out of my doors,
for I hear my wife’s voice (which, by
the by, is pretty distinguishable), and
in that corner of the room stands a good
cudgel, which somebody has felt before
now; if that light in her hands, and she
know the business you come about, without
consulting the stars, I can assure
you it will be employed very much to
the detriment of your person.&mdash;Sir,
cries he, bowing with great civility, I
perceive extreme grief for the loss of
the doctor disorders you a little at present,
but early in the morning I will wait
on you with all the necessary materials....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>

<p>“Well, once more I got my door
closed, and prepared for bed, in hopes
of a little repose after so many ruffling
adventures; just as I was putting out
my light in order to it, another bounces
as hard as he can knock; I open the
window and ask who is there and what
he wants? I am Ned, the sexton, replies
he, and come to know whether the doctor
left any orders for a funeral sermon,
and where he is to be laid, and whether
his grave is to be plain or bricked?&mdash;Why,
sirrah, say I, you know me well
enough; you know I am not dead, and
how dare you affront me after this manner?&mdash;Alackaday,
sir, replies the fellow,
why it is in print, and the whole town
knows you are dead; why, there is Mr.
White, the joiner, is fitting screws to
your coffin; he will be here with it in an
instant: he was afraid you would have
wanted it before this time.... In
short, what with undertakers, embalmers,
joiners, sextons, and your damned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
elegy hawkers upon a late practitioner
in physic and astrology, I got not one
wink of sleep the whole night, nor scarce
a moment’s rest ever since....</p>

<p>“I could not stir out of doors for the
space of three months after this, but
presently one comes up to me in the
street, Mr. Partridge, that coffin you was
last buried in, I have not yet been paid
for: Doctor, cries another dog, how do
you think people can live by making of
graves for nothing? next time you die,
you may even toll out the bell yourself
for Ned. A third rogue tips me by the
elbow, and wonders how I have the conscience
to sneak abroad without paying
my funeral expenses.&mdash;Lord, says one, I
durst have swore that was honest Dr.
Partridge, my old friend, but, poor man,
he is gone.&mdash;I beg your pardon, says
another, you look so like my old acquaintance
that I used to consult on
some private occasions; but, alack, he is
gone the way of all flesh.&mdash;Look, look,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
look, cries a third, after a competent
space of staring at me, would not one
think our neighbour, the almanack-maker,
was crept out of his grave, to
take the other peep at the stars in this
world, and shew how much he is improved
in fortune-telling by having
taken a journey to the other?...</p>

<p>“My poor wife is run almost distracted
with being called widow Partridge,
when she knows it is false; and
once a term she is cited into the court to
take out letters of administration. But
the greatest grievance is a paltry quack
that takes up my calling just under my
nose, and in his printed directions, with
N. B.&mdash;says he lives in the house of the
late ingenious Mr. John Partridge, an
eminent practitioner in leather, physic,
and astrology....”</p>

<p>The astrologer, forgetting to refer to
the stars for evidence, indignantly declared
himself to be alive, and Swift’s
returning “Vindication of Isaac Bickerstaff,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
Esq., against what is objected to
by Mr. Partridge in his Almanack for
the present year, 1709, by the said Isaac
Bickerstaff, Esq.,” complains:</p>

<p>“Mr. Partridge has been lately
pleased to treat me after a very rough
manner in that which is called his almanack
for the present year ... [regarding]
my predictions, which foretold the
death of Mr. Partridge to happen on
March 29, 1708. This he is pleased to
contradict absolutely in the almanack he
has published for the present year....</p>

<p>“Without entering into criticisms of
chronology about the hour of his death,
I shall only prove that Mr. Partridge is
not alive. And my first argument is
this: about a thousand gentlemen having
bought his almanacks for this year,
merely to find what he said against me,
at every line they read, they would lift
up their eyes, and cry out betwixt rage
and laughter, ‘they were sure no man
alive ever writ such damned stuff as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
this.’ Neither did I ever hear that opinion
disputed: ... Therefore, if an uninformed
carcase walks still about and
is pleased to call himself Partridge, Mr.
Bickerstaff does not think himself any
way answerable for that. Neither had
the said carcase any right to beat the
poor boy who happened to pass by it in
the street, crying, ‘A full and true account
of Dr. Partridge’s death,’ etc.</p>

<p>“... I will plainly prove him to be
dead, out of his own almanack for this
year, and from the very passage which
he produces to make us think him alive.
He there says ‘he is not only now alive,
but was also alive upon that very 29th
of March which I foretold he should die
on’: by this he declares his opinion that
a man may be alive now who was not
alive a twelvemonth ago. And indeed
there lies the sophistry of his argument.
He dares not assert he was alive ever
since that 29th of March, but that he ‘is
now alive and was so on that day’: I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
grant the latter; for he did not die till
night, as appears by the printed account
of his death, in a letter to a lord; and
whether he be since revived, I leave the
world to judge....”</p>

<p>The joke had gained its end; the astrologer
and philomath had been ridiculed
out of existence. But the name
of the “astrological ’squire” was in
everybody’s mouth; and when in April,
1709, Steele began “The Tatler,” Isaac
Bickerstaff, Esquire, spoke in the dedication
of a gentleman who “had written
Predictions, and Two or Three other
Pieces in my Name, which had render’d
it famous through all Parts of Europe;
and by an inimitable Spirit and Humour,
raised it to as high a Pitch of
Reputation as it could possibly arrive
at.”</p>

<p>The Inquisition in Portugal had, with
utmost gravity, condemned Bickerstaff’s
predictions and the readers of them, and
had burnt his predictions. The Company
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
of Stationers in London obtained
in 1709 an injunction against the issuing
of any almanac by John Partridge, as if
in fact he were dead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the fame of this foolery was
through all parts of Europe, it must also
have crossed to the English colonies of
America, and by reference to this fact
we may explain the curious literary parallel
Poor Richard’s Almanac affords.
Twenty-five years later Benjamin
Franklin played the selfsame joke in
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Franklin was but two years old when
Swift and his Bickerstaff coadjutors
were jesting. But by the time he had
grown and wandered to Philadelphia
and become a journeyman printer&mdash;by
1733&mdash;Addison, Steele, Prior, and Congreve
had died, and Swift’s wonderful
mind was turned upon and eating
itself in the silent deanery of St. Patrick’s.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

<p>Conditions about him gave Franklin
every opportunity for the jest. The
almanac in the America of 1733 had
even greater acceptance than the like
publication of England in Isaac Bickerstaff’s
day. No output of the colonial
press, not even the publication of theological
tracts, was so frequent or so remunerative.
It was the sole annual
which commonly penetrated the farmhouse
of the colonists, where it hung in
neighborly importance near the Bible,
Fox’s “Book of Martyrs,” and Jonathan
Edwards’s tractate on “The Freedom
of the Human Will.” And it had
uses. Besides furnishing a calendar,
weather prophecies, and jokes, it added
receipts for cooking, pickling, dyeing,
and in many ways was the “Useful
Companion” its title-page proclaimed.</p>

<p>So keen, practical, and energetic a
nature as Franklin’s could not let the
opportunity pass for turning a penny,
and with the inimitable adaptability
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
that marked him all his life he begins his
Poor Richard of 1733:</p>

<p>“Courteous Reader, I might in this
place attempt to gain thy favour by declaring
that I write Almanacks with no
other view than that of the publick good,
but in this I should not be sincere; and
men are now-a-days too wise to be deceiv’d
by pretences, how specious soever.
The plain truth of the matter is, I am
excessive poor, and my wife, good
woman, is, I tell her, excessive proud;
she can not bear, she says, to sit spinning
in her shift of tow, while I do
nothing but gaze at the stars; and has
threatened more than once to burn all
my books and rattling-traps (as she
calls my instruments), if I do not make
some profitable use of them for the good
of my family. The printer has offer’d
me some considerable share of the
profits, and I have thus began to comply
with my dame’s desire.</p>

<p>“Indeed, this motive would have had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
force enough to have made me publish
an Almanack many years since, had it
not been overpowered by my regard for
my good friend and fellow-student, Mr.
Titan Leeds, whose interest I was extreamly
unwilling to hurt. But this
obstacle (I am far from speaking it with
pleasure) is soon to be removed, since
inexorable death, who was never known
to respect merit, has already prepared
the mortal dart, the fatal sister has
already extended her destroying shears,
and that ingenious man must soon be
taken from us. He dies, by my calculation,
made at his request, on Oct. 17,
1733, 3 ho. 29 m., <small>P.M.</small>, at the very instant
of the ☌ of ☉ and ☿. By his own calculation
he will survive till the 26th of
the same month. This small difference
between us we have disputed whenever
we have met these nine years past; but
at length he is inclinable to agree with
my judgment. Which of us is most
exact, a little time will now determine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
As, therefore, these Provinces may not
longer expect to see any of his performances
after this year, I think myself free
to take up my task, and request a share
of publick encouragement, which I am
the more apt to hope for on this account,
that the buyer of my Almanack may
consider himself not only as purchasing
an useful utensil, but as performing an
act of charity to his poor</p>

<p class="author">
“Friend and servant,<br />
“<span class="smcap">R. Saunders</span>.”
</p>

<p>Franklin had a more eager biter than
Partridge proved to Bickerstaff’s bait,
and Titan Leeds, in his American Almanack
for 1734, showed how uneasy
was the hook:</p>

<p>“Kind Reader, Perhaps it may be expected
that I should say something concerning
an Almanack printed for the
Year 1733, said to be writ by Poor
Richard or Richard Saunders, who for
want of other matter was pleased to tell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
his Readers, that he had calculated my
Nativity, and from thence predicts my
Death to be the 17th of October, 1733.
At 29 min. past 3 a-clock in the Afternoon,
and that these Provinces may not
expect to see any more of his (Titan
Leeds) Performances, and this precise
Predicter, who predicts to a Minute,
proposes to succeed me in Writing of
Almanacks; but notwithstanding his
false Prediction, I have by the Mercy
of God lived to write a diary for the
Year 1734, and to publish the Folly and
Ignorance of this presumptuous Author.
Nay, he adds another gross Falsehood
in his Almanack, viz.&mdash;That by my own
Calculation, I shall survive until the
26th of the said Month (October), which
is as untrue as the former, for I do not
pretend to that Knowledge, altho’ he has
usurpt the Knowledge of the Almighty
herein, and manifested himself a Fool
and a Lyar. And by the mercy of God
I have lived to survive this conceited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
Scriblers Day and Minute whereon he
has predicted my Death; and as I have
supplyed my Country with Almanacks
for three seven Years by past, to general
Satisfaction, so perhaps I may live
to write when his Performances are
Dead. Thus much from your annual
Friend, Titan Leeds, October 18, 1733,
3 ho. 33 min. <small>P.M.</small>”</p>

<p>“... In the preface to my last Almanack,”
wrote Franklin, in genuine
humor, in Poor Richard for 1734, “I
foretold the death of my dear old friend
and fellow-student, the learned and ingenious
Mr. Titan Leeds, which was
to be the 17th of October, 1733, 3 h.,
29 m., <small>P.M.</small>, at the very instant of the
☌ of ☉ and ☿. By his own calculation, he
was to survive till the 26th of the same
month, and expire in the time of the
eclipse, near 11 o’clock <small>A.M.</small> At which
of these times he died, or whether he be
really yet dead, I cannot at this present
writing positively assure my readers;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
forasmuch as a disorder in my own
family demanded my presence, and
would not permit me, as I had intended,
to be with him in his last moments, to
receive his last embrace, to close his
eyes, and do the duty of a friend in performing
the last offices to the departed.
Therefore it is that I cannot positively
affirm whether he be dead or not; for
the stars only show to the skilful what
will happen in the natural and universal
chain of causes and effects; but ’tis well
known, that the events which would
otherwise certainly happen, at certain
times, in the course of nature, are sometimes
set aside or postpon’d, for wise
and good reasons, by the immediate particular
disposition of Providence; which
particular disposition the stars can by
no means discover or foreshow. There
is, however (and I can not speak it without
sorrow), there is the strongest probability
that my dear friend is no more;
for there appears in his name, as I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
assured, an Almanack for the year 1734,
in which I am treated in a very gross
and unhandsome manner, in which I am
called a false predicter, an ignorant, a
conceited scribbler, a fool and a lyar.
Mr. Leeds was too well bred to use any
man so indecently and so scurrilously,
and moreover his esteem and affection
for me was extraordinary; so that it is
to be feared that pamphlet may be only
a contrivance of somebody or other, who
hopes, perhaps, to sell two or three
years’ Almanacks still, by the sole force
and virtue of Mr. Leeds’ name. But,
certainly, to put words into the mouth
of a gentleman and a man of letters
against his friend, which the meanest
and most scandalous of the people
might be ashamed to utter even in a
drunken quarrel, is an unpardonable
injury to his memory, and an imposition
upon the publick.</p>

<p>“Mr. Leeds was not only profoundly
skilful in the useful science he profess’d,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
but he was a man of exemplary sobriety,
a most sincere friend, and an exact performer
of his word. These valuable
qualifications, with many others, so
much endeared him to me, that although
it should be so, that, contrary to all probability,
contrary to my prediction and
his own, he might possibly be yet alive,
yet my loss of honour, as a prognosticate,
cannot afford me so much mortification
as his life, health, and safety
would give me joy and satisfaction....”</p>

<p>Again, Leeds, in The American Almanack
for 1735, returns Franklin’s jest:</p>

<p>“Courteous and Kind Reader: My
Almanack being in its usual Method,
needs no Explanation; but perhaps it
may be expected by some that I shall
say something concerning Poor Richard,
or otherwise Richard Saunders’s Almanack,
which I suppose was printed in
the Year 1733 for the ensuing Year
1734, wherein he useth me with such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
good Manners, I can hardly find what to
say to him, without it is to advise him
not to be too proud because by his Prædicting
my Death, and his writing an
Almanack....</p>

<p>“But if Falsehood and Inginuity be
so rewarded, What may he expect if
ever he be in a capacity to publish that
that is either Just or according to Art?
Therefore I shall say little more about
it than, as a Friend, to advise he will
never take upon him to prædict or
ascribe any Person’s Death, till he has
learned to do it better than he did
before....”</p>

<p>To this exhortation Franklin makes
the following gay sally in Poor Richard
for 1735.</p>

<p>“... Whatever may be the musick of
the spheres, how great soever the harmony
of the stars, ’tis certain there is
no harmony among the star-gazers: but
they are perpetually growling and snarling
at one another like strange curs, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
like some men at their wives. I had resolved
to keep the peace on my own part,
and offend none of them; and I shall
persist in that resolution. But having
receiv’d much abuse from Titan Leeds
deceas’d (Titan Leeds when living
would not have used me so): I say,
having receiv’d much abuse from the
ghost of Titan Leeds, who pretends to
be still living, and to write Almanacks
in spight of me and my predictions, I
can not help saying, that tho’ I take it
patiently, I take it very unkindly. And
whatever he may pretend, ’tis undoubtedly
true that he is really defunct and
dead. First, because the stars are seldom
disappointed, never but in the case
of wise men, sapiens dominabitur asties,
and they foreshadowed his death at the
time I predicted it. Secondly, ’twas
requisite and necessary he should die
punctually at that time for the honor of
astrology, the art professed both by him
and his father before him. Thirdly, ’tis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
plain to every one that reads his two
last Almanacks (for 1734 and ’35), that
they are not written with that life his
performances used to be written with;
the wit is low and flat; the little hints
dull and spiritless; nothing smart in
them but Hudibras’s verses against
astrology at the heads of the months in
the last, which no astrologer but a dead
one would have inserted, and no man
living would or could write such stuff
as the rest. But lastly, I shall convince
him from his own words that he is dead
(ex ore suo condemnatus est); for in
his preface to his Almanack for 1734,
he says: ‘Saunders adds another gross
falsehood in his Almanack, viz., that by
my own calculation, I shall survive until
the 26th of the said month, October, 1733,
which is as untrue as the former.’ Now
if it be as Leeds says, untrue and a
gross falsehood, that he survived till the
26th of October, 1733, then it is certainly
true that he died before that time; and
if he died before that time he is dead
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
now to all intents and purposes, anything
he may say to the contrary notwithstanding.
And at what time before
the 26th is it so likely he should die, as
at the time by me predicted, viz., the
17th of October aforesaid? But if some
people will walk and be troublesome
after death, it may perhaps be borne
with a little, because it cannot well be
avoided, unless one would be at the
pains and expense of laying them in the
Red Sea; however, they should not presume
too much upon the liberty allowed
them. I know confinement must needs
be mighty irksome to the free spirit of
an astronomer, and I am too compassionate
to proceed suddenly to extremities
with it; nevertheless, tho’ I resolve
with reluctance, I shall not long defer,
if it does not speedily learn to treat its
living friends with better manners.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<p>Here for the nonce the jeu d’esprit
ended. In carrying the matter further
Franklin hardly showed the taste of
Bickerstaff. The active, bristling, self-assertive
ὕβρις which characterized his
early manhood led him further on to
stand over the very grave of Leeds.
Before he made his Almanac for 1740
his competitor had died. But even
Leeds dead he seemed to deem fair play.</p>

<p class="author">“October 7, 1739.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Courteous Reader</span>: You may remember
that in my first Almanack, published
for the year 1733, I predicted the
death of my dear friend, Titan Leeds,
Philomat, to happen that year on the
17th day of October, 3 h. 29 m. <small>P.M.</small> The
good man, it seems, died accordingly.
But W. B. and A. B.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> have continued
to publish Almanacks in his name ever
since; asserting for some years that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
was still living. At length when the
truth could no longer be concealed from
the world, they confessed his death in
their Almanack for 1739, but pretended
that he died not till last year, and that
before his departure he had furnished
them with calculations for 7 years to
come.&mdash;Ah, my friends, these are poor
shifts and thin disguises; of which
indeed I should have taken little or no
notice, if you had not at the same time
accused me as a false predictor; an
aspersion that the more affects me as my
whole livelyhood depends on a contrary
character.</p>

<p>“But to put this matter beyond dispute,
I shall acquaint the world with a
fact, as strange and surprising as it is
true; being as follows, viz.:</p>

<p>“On the 4th instant, toward midnight,
as I sat in my little study writing this
Preface, I fell fast asleep; and continued
in that condition for some time,
without dreaming any thing, to my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
knowledge. On awaking I found lying
before me the following, viz.:</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Friend Saunders</span>: My respect
for you continues even in this separate
state; and I am griev’d to see the
aspersions thrown on you by the malevolence
of avaricious publishers of Almanacks,
who envy your success. They say
your prediction of my death in 1733 was
false, and they pretend that I remained
alive many years after. But I do hereby
certify that I did actually die at that
time, precisely at the hour you mention’d,
with a variation only of 5 min.
53 sec, which must be allow’d to be no
great matter in such cases. And I do
further declare that I furnish’d them
with no calculations of the planets’
motions, etc., seven years after my
death, as they are pleased to give out:
so that the stuff they publish as an Almanack
in my name is no more mine than
’tis yours.</p>

<p>“‘You will wonder, perhaps, how this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
paper comes written on your table. You
must know that no separate spirits are
under any confinement till after the final
settlement of all accounts. In the meantime
we wander where we please, visit
our old friends, observe their actions,
enter sometimes into their imaginations,
and give them hints waking or sleeping
that may be of advantage to them.
Finding you asleep, I enter’d your left
nostril, ascended into your brain, found
out where the ends of those nerves were
fastened that move your right hand and
fingers, by the help of which I am now
writing unknown to you; but when you
open your eyes you will see that the
hand written is mine, tho’ wrote with
yours.</p>

<p>“‘The people of this infidel age, perhaps,
will hardly believe this story. But
you may give them these three signs by
which they shall be convinced of the
truth of it.&mdash;About the middle of June
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
next, J. J&mdash;&mdash;n,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Philomat, shall be
openly reconciled to the Church of
Rome, and give all his goods and chattels
to the chappel, being perverted by
a certain country schoolmaster. On the
7th of September following my old
Friend W. B&mdash;&mdash;t shall be sober 9
hours, to the astonishment of all his
neighbours:&mdash;And about the same time
W. B. and A. B. will publish another
Almanack in my name, in spight of truth
and common sense.</p>

<p>“‘As I can see much clearer into
futurity, since I got free from the dark
prison of flesh, in which I was continually
molested and almost blinded with
fogs arising from tiff, and the smoke of
burnt drams; I shall in kindness to you,
frequently give you information of
things to come, for the improvement of
your Almanack: being, Dear Dick, Your
Affectionate Friend,<br />
<span class="author">“‘<span class="smcap">T. Leeds</span>.’</span><br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span></p>

<p>“For my own part, I am convinced
that the above letter is genuine. If the
reader doubts of it, let him carefully
observe the three signs; and if they do
not actually come to pass, believe as he
pleases. I am his humble Friend,<br />
<span class="author">“<span class="smcap">R. Saunders</span>.”</span></p>

<p>In this wise ended Poor Richard’s
jest. Franklin’s style throughout is so
simple and direct that one is at first inclined
to scout the suggestion that the
joke is not entirely original. It is impossible,
however, to suppose that Franklin,
with his broad reading, did not know
Squire Bickerstaff’s. The development
of the humor is wholly imitated. But
Franklin made the method his own so
thoroughly that his wit has those keener,
subtler, more agile qualities which have
distinguished American from the slower
and sedater humor of the English. In
the Bickerstaff jocularity evidences of
the death of Partridge are enumerated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
in material surroundings of a not too
prosperous London quack. Franklin, on
the other hand, ironically and graphically
reasons upon supposititious traits
and qualities of character and breeding.</p>

<p>In England, Swift’s squib having
given the death-blow to astrology, “Merlinus
Liberatus, by John Partridge,”
was published years after, but shorn of
its specious and misleading pretences.
Franklin’s jesting was more self-seeking.</p>

<p>Not one of Franklin’s biographers or
editors has referred to the Bickerstaff
joke. Upon the contrary, in an “Introduction
to Fac-simile of Poor Richard’s
Almanack for 1733,” published by The
Duodecimos in 1894, it is asserted that
Franklin “in a strain of delightful satire
upon the already venerable pretensions
of almanac-makers to foretell the future,
... disposes of this difficulty by
a method so novel, so ingenious, and
withal of an illuminating power so far-reaching
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
as to set the whole colony talking
about it.”</p>

<p>It need hardly be added that none of
Swift’s biographers&mdash;all being English&mdash;have
hinted at Franklin’s pleasantry.</p>

<p>The inextinguishable laughter&mdash;the
true Homeric ἄσβεστος γέλως&mdash;which is
the atmosphere of both incidents, fits
them to rank with the imaginary durance
of Sancho Panza upon his island,
or with Tartarin in Tarascon, or, to go
to the first humor of literature, with the
advance and retreat of Thersites in the
council of Zeus-nourished kings. And
in Britain and America all our heroes
were real.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon other occasions than the Saunders-Leeds
jesting Franklin loved playful
feint; he had “Bagatelles” for his
delight. It was a quizzical side of the
character which made him the first of
our notable American humorists. To
amuse himself with an oriental apologue
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
which he called “The Parable of Persecution,”
he had the story bound with a
Bible. From this book he would read
the legend aloud, amazing his auditors
that so beautiful a scriptural passage
had escaped their knowledge.</p>

<p>The form in which Franklin cast the
tale is this:</p>

<p>“And it came to pass after these
things, that Abraham sat in the door of
his tent, about the going down of the
sun.</p>

<p>“And behold a man, bowed with age,
came from the way of the wilderness,
leaning on a staff.</p>

<p>“And Abraham arose and met him,
and said unto him, ‘Turn in, I pray
thee, and wash thy feet, and tarry all
night, and thou shalt arise early on the
morrow, and go thy way,’</p>

<p>“But the man said, ‘Nay, for I will
abide under this tree.’</p>

<p>“And Abraham pressed him greatly:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
so he turned and they went into the tent,
and Abraham baked unleavened bread,
and they did eat.</p>

<p>“And when Abraham saw that the
man blessed not God, he said unto him,
‘Wherefore dost thou not worship the
most high God, Creator of heaven and
earth?’</p>

<p>“And the man answered and said, ‘I
do not worship the God thou speakest of,
neither do I call upon his name; for
I have made to myself a god, which
abideth alway in mine house, and provideth
me with all things.’</p>

<p>“And Abraham’s zeal was kindled
against the man, and he arose and fell
upon him, and drove him forth with
blows into the wilderness.</p>

<p>“And at midnight God called unto
Abraham, saying, ‘Abraham, where is
the stranger?’</p>

<p>“And Abraham answered and said,
‘Lord, he would not worship thee,
neither would he call upon thy name;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
therefore have I driven him out from
before my face into the wilderness.’</p>

<p>“And God said, ‘Have I borne with
him these hundred and ninety and eight
years, and nourished him, and clothed
him, notwithstanding his rebellion
against me; and couldst not thou, that
art thyself a sinner, bear with him one
night?’</p>

<p>“And Abraham said, ‘Let not the
anger of the Lord wax hot against his
servant; lo, I have sinned; lo, I have
sinned; forgive me, I pray thee.’</p>

<p>“And Abraham arose, and went forth
into the wilderness, and sought diligently
for the man, and found him, and
returned with him to the tent; and
when he had treated him kindly, he
sent him away on the morrow with gifts.</p>

<p>“And God spake again unto Abraham,
saying, ‘For this thy sin shall thy seed
be afflicted four hundred years in a
strange land.</p>

<p>“‘But for thy repentance will I deliver
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
them; and they shall come forth
with power, and with gladness of heart,
and with much substance.’”</p>

<p>Franklin’s fine literary sense and feeling
would doubtless have told him that
the tale was oriental, even if Jeremy
Taylor, whose “Discourse on the Liberty
of Prophesying” it brings to a
finish, had not introduced it with the
words, “I end with a story which I find
in the Jews’ book.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>“When Abraham sat at his tent-door,
according to his custom, waiting to

entertain strangers, he espied an old
man stooping and leaning on his staff,
weary with age and travail, coming
toward him, who was a hundred years of
age; he received him kindly, washed his
feet, provided supper, caused him to sit
down; but, observing that the old man
eat and prayed not, nor begged for a
blessing on his meat, he asked him why
he did not worship the God of heaven.
The old man told him that he worshipped
the fire only, and acknowledged no other
god. At which answer Abraham grew
so zealously angry that he thrust the old
man out of his tent, and exposed him to
all the evils of the night and an unguarded
condition. When the old man
was gone, God called to Abraham, and
asked him where the stranger was. He
replied, ‘I thrust him away because he
did not worship thee.’ God answered
him, ‘I have suffered him these hundred
years, although he dishonoured me; and
couldst not thou endure him one night,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
when he gave thee no trouble?’ Upon
this saith the story, Abraham fetched
him back again, and gave him hospitable
entertainment and wise instruction. Go
thou and do likewise, and thy charity
will be rewarded by the God of Abraham.”</p>

<p>Franklin’s pleasantries with this parable
led Lord Kames to ask it of him.
The fertile Scotchman at once incorporated
it in his “Sketches of the History
of Man,” and published it in 1774,
accrediting it to Franklin. “The charge
of plagiarism has, on this account,” says
Bishop Heber, in his life of Jeremy
Taylor, “been raised against Franklin;
though he cannot be proved to have
given it to Lord Kames as his own composition.
With all Franklin’s abilities
and amiable qualities,” continues the
clear-eyed bishop, “there was a degree
of quackery in his character which ...
has made the imputation of such a theft
more readily received against him than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
it would have been against most other
men of equal eminence.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In more finely sensitive writers who
have treated Franklin there is a feeling
that he “borrowed.” The words of the
missionary bishop show the sentiment
was common in England a century and
a quarter ago. In our country the conviction
was expressed with more spirit
in a colloquy<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> between a New England
man and a Virginian, preserved
in John Davis’s manuscript, “Travels
in America during 1798-99, 1800, 1801,
1802.”</p>

<p>“I obtained,” wrote Davis of his visit
to Washington, “accommodations at the
Washington Tavern, which stands opposite
the Treasury. At this tavern I
took my meals at the public table, where
there was every day to be found a number
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
of clerks, employed at the different
offices under government, together with
about half-a-dozen Virginians and a few
New England men. There was a perpetual
conflict between these Southern
and Northern men, and one night I was
present at a vehement dispute, which
terminated in the loss of a horse, a saddle,
and bridle. The dispute was about
Dr. Franklin; the man from New England,
enthusiastic in what related to
Franklin, asserted that the Doctor, being
self-taught, was original in everything
that he had ever published.</p>

<p>“The Virginian maintained that he
was a downright plagiarist.</p>

<p>“<i>New England Man.</i>&mdash;Have you a
horse here, my friend?</p>

<p>“<i>Virginian.</i>&mdash;Sir, I hope you do not
suppose that I came hither on foot from
Virginia. I have him in Mr. White’s
stable, the prettiest Chickasaw that ever
trod upon four pasterns.</p>

<p>“<i>New England Man.</i>&mdash;And I have a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
bay mare that I bought for ninety dollars
in hard cash. Now I, my friend,
will lay my bay mare against your Chickasaw
that Dr. Franklin is not a plagiarist.</p>

<p>“<i>Virginian.</i>&mdash;Done! Go it! Waiter!
You, waiter!</p>

<p>“The waiter obeyed the summons,
and, at the order of the Virginian,
brought down a portmanteau containing
both Franklin’s ‘Miscellanies’ and
Taylor’s ‘Discourses.’</p>

<p>“The New England man then read
from the former the celebrated parable
against persecution.... And after he
had finished he exclaimed that the
‘writer appeared inspired.’</p>

<p>“But the Virginian maintained that it
all came to Franklin from Bishop Taylor’s
book, printed more than a century
ago. And the New England man read
from Taylor.... When he had done
reading, a laugh ensued; and the Virginian,
leaping from his seat, called to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
Atticus, the waiter, to put the bay mare
in the next stall to the Chickasaw and
to give her half a gallon of oats more,
upon the strength of her having a new
master!</p>

<p>“The New England man exhibited
strong symptoms of chagrin, but wagered
‘a brand-new saddle’ that this
celebrated epitaph of Franklin’s undergoing
a new edition was original. The
epitaph was then read:</p>

<p class="caption">
‘The Body<br />
of<br />
Benjamin Franklin, Printer<br />
(Like the cover of an old book,<br />
Its contents torn out,<br />
And stript of its lettering and gilding),<br />

Yet the work itself shall not be lost,<br />
For it will (as he believ’d) appear once more,<br />
In a new<br />
And more beautiful Edition,<br />
Corrected and Amended<br />
By<br />
The Author.’<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span></p>

<p>“The Virginian then said that Franklin
robbed a little boy of it. ‘The very
words, sir, are taken from a Latin epitaph
written on a bookseller, by an Eton
scholar.</p>

<p>“And then, says Mr. Davis, the bet
was awarded the Virginian. He referred
to the ‘Gentleman’s Magazine’
for February, 1736, where the Latin
inscription accredited to the Eton
scholar, with a translation by a Mr.
P&mdash;&mdash;, was to be found.</p>

<p>“After this second decision the Virginian
declared that he would lay his
boots against the New Englander’s that
Franklin’s pretended discovery of calming
troubled waters by pouring upon
them oil might be found in the third
book of Bede’s ‘History of the Church;’
or that his facetious essay on the air-bath
is produced, word for word, from
Aubrey’s ‘Miscellanies.’ But the New
Englander, who had lost horse, saddle,
and bridle, declined to run the risk on
Dr. Franklin of going home without his
boots.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are other instances of the
philosopher’s palpable taking. To one,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
Franklin’s editor, Mr. Bigelow, adverts
when he notes in Franklin’s letter of
November 5, 1789, to Alexander Smith:
“I find by your letter that every man
has patience enough to hear calmly and
coolly the injuries done to other people.”
The marvellous precision and terseness
of Swift&mdash;that keen, incisive melancholy
wit of his from which great writers have
taken ideas and phrases as gold-seekers
have picked nuggets from California
earth&mdash;Swift had more finely said what
Franklin stumbled after when he wrote
that he “never knew a man who could
not bear the misfortunes of another like
a Christian.”</p>

<p>Franklin had originality. His many
devices are evidence. But careful study
of that which brought him much public
attention&mdash;bagatelles by which he attached
himself to popular affection&mdash;show
all-round appropriation. He
loved to stand in public light&mdash;to hear
applause of himself. He loved to quiz
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
his listeners, to bamboozle his readers.
If his buying and applauding public
believed Poor Richard’s proverbs
sprang from his active mind instead of
having been industriously gathered from
old English and other folk proverbs and
dyed with his practical humor&mdash;“the
wisdom of many ages and nations,” as
Franklin afterwards put it&mdash;that was
their blunder by which he would gain
gold as well as glory. Even “Richard
Saunders” was not original with Franklin.
It was the pen-name of a compiler
of English almanacs. The young
printer busily working his press doubtless
chuckled at his deceptions&mdash;in spite
of his filched maxim about honesty being
the best policy.</p>

<p>And it went with him all through life.
His love of public applause, his desire
to accumulate and his gleaming, quizzical
humor led him on. His wonderful
ease at adopting others’ products and
making them his own one may admire
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
if he turn his eyes from the moral significance,
the downright turpitude of
not acknowledging the source. Franklin’s
practice would certainly not stand
the test of universal application which
his great contemporary, Kant, demanded
of all acts.</p>

<p>There has been of late endeavor to
rehabilitate Franklin’s industrious common
sense and praise its circumstance.
So late as last year our American ambassador
to St. James addressed students
of the Workingmen’s College in
London upon the energy, self-help, and
sense of reality of this early American,
and found the leading features of his
character to be honesty (!) and respect
for facts.</p>

<p>It is, after all, a certain grace inherent
in Franklin, a human feeling, a
genial simplicity and candor, a directness
of utterance and natural unfolding
of his matter which are his perennial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
value in a literary way, and which warrant
the estimate of an English critic
who calls him the most readable writer
yet known on the western side of the
Atlantic.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
